    <title>Installing Kicksecure breaks NFS</title>
    <link>https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/installing-kicksecure-breaks-nfs/396</link>
    <description>on a debian 12 install, I configured NFS for use on my local LAN. I did intsall network-manager-gnome and openvpn..

after my client was able to mount the remote (local LAN). after installing kicksecure, I cannot get them to connect.

connection timeout when trying to mount from the command line.

I have double shecked hosts.allow and exports on the server, but they didnt seem to have been altered by installing kicksecure.

I DO have multiple NIC installed (4). 2 in use to WAN via router1, and 1 in use to router2 (local LAN)

portlist shows tcp 2049
rpcinfo shows
portmapper ports 111 TCP &amp; UDP for versions 2,3,4
nfs ports 2049 TCP versions 3 &amp; 4, and a nfs_acl on 2049 for version 3

ideally i would prefer to have an IP or MAC verified w/o kerberos, but I will take what I can at the moment I cant get mount working...</description>
