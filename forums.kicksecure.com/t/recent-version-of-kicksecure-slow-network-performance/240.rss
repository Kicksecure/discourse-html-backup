    <title>Recent Version of Kicksecure Slow Network Performance</title>
    <link>https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/recent-version-of-kicksecure-slow-network-performance/240</link>
    <description>Hello, I&#39;ve been a big supporter of both Kicksecure and Whonix for many years and noticed that the latest version of Kicksecure with kernel 5.10.XX has noticeably slower network performance compared to older versions.

I&#39;ve tested with Virtualbox and KVM (forward mode bridged &amp; nat).

Has anything changed about the system, in terms of configs, settings or packages relating to networking, that could have caused this?
