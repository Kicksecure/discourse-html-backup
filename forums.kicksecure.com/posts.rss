</aside>
<p>Just because it’s going to have TPM support doesn’t mean it will be bloated; that’s a wrong assumption to begin with. We can also remove FDE support in this case (which can be done post-installation), and we call that keep it minimal. So, ‘minimal’ is undefined, and TPM is default in almost all main distro installers, whether Debian, Qubes, openSUSE…etc. It’s not like we’re doing the unusual.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>True, but you missed a crucial point: TPM adds an extra layer of security by binding the key file to the device’s hardware, meaning the encryption keys or key files will be tied to the specific hardware of the device. This prevents an attacker from simply copying the key file to another machine to decrypt the data. The decryption key is “unsealed” only when the system’s hardware and firmware are in a trusted state, thereby adding protection against physical attacks and tampering.</p>

</aside>
<p>It really doesn’t matter how TPM will be used by the user, what matters is that support for it exists and is easily available.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that TPM has undeniable utility, whether it is fully trusted or not is beside the point. Not having it available from the installer level is a minus, not a plus to the distro features.</p> ]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>The abstract action for the user is “become root - one way or another”.</p>
<p>It might be difficult to perfect the documentation because there are many different ways to install Debian.</p>
<ul>
<li>D-I (console looking old installer)</li>
<li>calamares (graphical installer coming with Debian Live)</li>
</ul>
<p>And two options:</p>
<ul>
<li>enable root account, set root password</li>
<li>don’t enable root account</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s at least 4 options.</p>
<p>So either su or sudo needs to be used (assuming that in some cases, Debian sets up sudo and add user “user” to group sudo by default).</p>
<p>If su cannot be used, just prepend all commands needing root (administative) rights with sudo. Or use <code>sudo su</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why TPM is important:</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.invisiblethings.org/2011/09/07/anti-evil-maid.html" class="inline-onebox">Anti Evil Maid | The Invisible Things Blog</a></p>
<p>Good point:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>use custom TPM SRK password (so, you did <em>not</em> pass -z to tpm_takeownership), then you can install Anti Evil Maid onto your regular boot partition.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>There are many very different ways to use a TPM. While a TPM has much less features than a CPU, a general feature request “use the TPM” is as useful as “make us of the CPU”. These topics should not be mixed.</p>
<p>This is mostly in a completely different context for TPM usage. Boot security / firmware security that utilizes TPM for messurements fortunately is unrelated to calamares. To accomplish <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Measured_boot">measured boot</a>, anti evil maid, fortunately no code in any Linux installer is required. This is based on boot firmware and operating system support.</p>
<p>Using a boot firmware and operating system that supports pressured boot, <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Verified_Boot">verified boot</a> which makes use of the TPM, might increase security. Using a TPM for transparent encryption however is completely different, optional feature, decision.</p>
<p>There is no general “use the TPM” feature which calamares could (or should) implement. Instead, very specific proposals on how to utilize the TPM could be written by developers for the purpose of increasesd security. Such features then, don’t necessarily (and hopefully) don’t need to be implemented at the calamares level, which I would hope to stay minimal.</p>
<p>A useful <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Dev/image_formats#Goals">Goals</a> I support is:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The differences in the code base for Live Systems vs. Installer Systems vs. Installed Systems should be reduced as much as possible.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>So I want to provide a generic image for users to download. The image should be able to be flashed on an internal hard drive, a USB drive, on a server or anywhere else.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then calamares would not even be required anymore. It’s a lot of engineering work ahead to get there and it’s not even clear if this can or will ever happen.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Installer specific code should be as minimal as possible.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Good point to why use USB to unlock your PC:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anti Evil Maid on a separate USB stick rather than on your built-in disk boot partition. This is because you can use Anti Evil Maid as a provider of a keyfile to your LUKS disk encryption (as an additional file unsealable by the TPM). This way you could also stop adversary that is able to sniff your keystrokes (e.g. using hidden camera, or electromagnetic leak), and capture your disk decryption passphrase (see the discussion in the next section).</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Protection from an adversary that is sniffing full disk encryption passwords using cameras, doesn’t need require a TPM. Protection from that requires only an additional keyfile on USB. Keyfiles predate TPM.</p>
<p>It however doesn’t protect from an adversary that can sniff the full disk encryption password and steal the USB device including the keyfile. But a TPM won’t either.</p>
<p>I am not aware of any Linux installer that allows setting up password + keyfile on USB + backup keyfile on another USB. I would hope that there is no need to re-invent such a feature for every Linux installer and that this could instead abstracted into a general project.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that usability using cryptsetup, setting up keyfiles on USB is currently very bad. It is possible to do this manually but very difficult for users. I don’t know any Linux distribution solving that. But then again, there is no magic answer. And this problem also cannot be solved by saying “use the TPM (in calamare or anywhere)”.</p>
<p>Password + keyfile on USB would indeed protect against camera password sniffing + stealing of a powered off notebook.</p>
<p>However, that calamares TPM ticket <a href="https://github.com/calamares/calamares/issues/2355" class="inline-onebox">TPM Encryption support · Issue #2355 · calamares/calamares · GitHub</a> does not suggest that. It only suggests adding <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Full_Disk_Encryption#TPM_Transparent_Encryption">TPM Transparent Encryption</a> support. This is a security reduction. It is vulnerable to a new class of attacks: warm cold boot attacks. (As described in the wiki.) (Not to be confused with the “classic”, “normal” cold boot attacks.)</p>
<p>This is also the way which the Ubuntu installer allegedly can use the TPM for.</p>
<p>As the developer in that ticket pointed out:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In any case an explanation of what the feature is, what it does, how it is used in Ubuntus, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To make good use of a TPM for full disk encryption, it is important define adversary capabilities, the threat model. Added some of that here just now:<br>
<a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Full_Disk_Encryption#TPM_Full_Disk_Encryption_Threat_Modeling">TPM Full Disk Encryption Threat Modeling</a></p>
<hr>
<p>As for using USB to unlock full disk encryption at boot that is great. (And no TPM required.)</p>
<p>But then is the question, use password + USB (more secure) or use USB only (less secure, more convenient)?</p>
<p>If that is a feature request, please open a separate forum thread for that.</p> ]]></description>

<p>Good point:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>use custom TPM SRK password (so, you did <em>not</em> pass -z to tpm_takeownership), then you can install Anti Evil Maid onto your regular boot partition.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Good point to why use USB to unlock your PC:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anti Evil Maid on a separate USB stick rather than on your built-in disk boot partition. This is because you can use Anti Evil Maid as a provider of a keyfile to your LUKS disk encryption (as an additional file unsealable by the TPM). This way you could also stop adversary that is able to sniff your keystrokes (e.g. using hidden camera, or electromagnetic leak), and capture your disk decryption passphrase (see the discussion in the next section).</p>

        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@Patrick]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <blockquote>
<p>First, why should “I do not have a hidden partition” be any more plausible than “I forgot my crypto key” or “I wiped that partition with random data, nothing in there”? I do not see any reason.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because if someone is traveling with 1 notebook (or only owns 1 notebook) then “I wiped that partition with random data, nothing in there” is less credible than “I do not have a hidden partition”. This is because people usually don’t like traveling with broken notebooks.</p>
<p>To illustrate this point further, consider a traveling group of 5 attendants to an IT conference. They all traveling with unbootable notebooks which they just wiped with random data while keeping their bootloader (and /boot partition) intact? Possible but incredible.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately “plausible deniability” also means you cannot prove there<br>
is no hidden data.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s why plausible deniability is a scary feature to implement. Because then those not using it cannot prove they don’t have one except by creating an empty/skeleton way.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately that is also glaringly obvious, as you then cannot write<br>
to the filesystem without a high risk of destroying data in the hidden<br>
container.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>TrueCrypt solved that with a “protect hidden volume” feature, where the user needed during normal operation to always enter both passwords, one for the normal/decoy volume and one for the hidden volume.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Have not written anything to the encrypted filesystem in a<br>
while?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s why the concept of a decoy volume is flawed. It would need to be frequently enough used to leave enough of a usage pattern to be credible later that it is an actively used operating system or volume.</p>
<p>A better concept would be frequently using the “normal” volume. And then only place high risk files in the “hidden” volume.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To be fair, if you prepare option b) carefully and directly before going<br>
into danger, it may work.  But then, the mere presence of encrypted data<br>
may already be enough to get you into trouble in those places were they<br>
can demand encryption keys.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes.</p>
<ul>
<li>A) Those not using hidden volume: indefinite torture because there is no hidden volume to physical abuse.</li>
<li>B) Those using hidden volume: given up both normal and hidden volume due to physical abuse.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Here is an additional reference for some problems with plausible<br>
deniability:<br>
<a href="https://www.schneier.com/academic/paperfiles/paper-truecrypt-dfs.pdf">https://www.schneier.com/academic/paperfiles/paper-truecrypt-dfs.pdf</a><br>
I strongly suggest you read it.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>In summary, there are a lot conceptual challenges, let alone technical implementation challenges.</p> ]]></description>

<blockquote>
<p>Still confused about meaning of plausible deniabilty</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Plausibly deniable encryption is a full disk encryption scheme where the encrypted volume looks like pure random noise. There’s no way to distinguish the volume from random junk unless you have the decryption key. The only way to prove with absolute certainty that encryption is being used on the drive, is to have the encryption key and be able to successfully decrypt the data.</p>
<p>In order to achieve this, there has to be <em>no</em> plaintext volume or file metadat stored on the same disk as the encrypted volume. This disqualifies LUKS because there is a plaintext header containing metadata about the LUKS volume. This header doesn’t contain any info that could be used to decrypt the disk without the key, but it’s enough to establish that disk encryption is in use, which could potentially put one’s physical wellbeing in danger if under attack by a sufficiently ruthless and powerful attacker.</p>
<p>The idea behind plausibly deniable encryption is to make it so that a victim in such an attack <em>could</em> lie about their use of full disk encryption and be believed anyway. There’s no way to prove that encrypted data is on the disk, thus someone could claim there isn’t any and <em>potentially</em> be believed.</p>
<p>While it sounds powerful in theory, there are quite a few problems with this:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you store a plausibly deniable encrypted volume on the same disk with other data, you’re left with an (almost certainly very large) chunk of space on your disk that is either partitioned but shown as having no filesystem, or that is excluded from partitioning entirely. Almost no one uses their computer with a large block of unallocated or unformatted space on their disk, so this alone is suspicious.</li>
<li>The data on the disk still looks like random noise. You can’t make it look like valid data. This means that the only lie you can plausibly tell is one that states or implies that the drive was wiped with random data at some point. This is potentially believable if you devote an entire drive to the encrypted volume (and I mean the whole drive, you can’t even use a partition table if you want this to be really believable), but if you have other partitions on the same drive, this raises even worse suspicions because now you’re claiming that you have a <em>pointless</em> block of unallocated or unformatted space on your disk. At this point your attacker can be virtually certain you’re using an encrypted volume, <em>and</em> that you’re trying to hide it.</li>
<li>Even under ideal circumstances, the attacker can prove beyond a <em>reasonable</em> doubt that you’re using an encrypted volume if they can take multiple snapshots of the drive at different times, and you modify data on the encrypted volume after the first snapshot but before one or more subsequent snapshots. This is because the attacker see that the bits in the “pointless” unallocated space <em>are changing</em>. This indicates that you’re writing to that area of the drive, and therefore that you most likely are using it for some particular purpose. Could you lie to get around this? Maybe, perhaps you could claim that you’re using that area of the drive to store random data for some project of some sort and that you need to change the data in use every so often, but that’s a pretty flimsy excuse when at this point your drive is exhibiting behavior that 99.99% of the time is the result of someone using plausibly deniable encryption. You’d also have to use that excuse the first time you were confronted by the attacker and then stick to it, otherwise you’d end up changing stories which similarly proves that you’re hiding something.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ultimately, plausibly deniable encryption is potentially useful when dealing with a ruthless attacker, but it’s a very weak defense unless used <em>perfectly</em>, and even then it’s flimsy. I imagine the best way to use it would be to encrypt an entire external USB drive (not even using a partition table on the drive), then prefill the drive with important data, and then never, EVER write any data to the drive after initially preparing it. Then only use the volume to refer to information as you need it. You can then tell an attacker that you bought a used drive to help you store extra data in case you needed more storage space, and that you made no modifications to the drive since you purchased it. They can then conclude that the original owner overwrote the drive with random data. If they take multiple snapshots of the drive over time, they will never see it change and can conclude that you haven’t reformatted the drive yet. You could potentially get away with writing data to the volume until the first time the attacker takes a snapshot, then use the volume read-only after that point. This requires that you know <em>when</em> the attacker takes the first snapshot though, which isn’t something you can guarantee if your attacker can gain unattended physical access to your machine.</p>
<p>(It’s also worth noting that “never write to the drive” is also tricky because some (most?) filesystems have metadata on them that gets changed just by mounting the filesystem. Even a read-only mount can result in data being written to the drive in some situations. It might be possible to use something like <code>hdparm -r1</code> to set the drive itself into read-only mode, thus bypassing anything scary the filesystem could potentially do. But not all drives will necessarily work with that, and I imagine you might run into issues with some or even most USB drives since <code>hdparm</code> is designed to work with SATA and IDE drives. I wonder if Linux has a feature that allows you to set a device file itself into read-only mode irrespective of the underlying hardware…)</p>

<p>Why its hard to achieve</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Plausible deniability of this kind isn’t really hard to achieve, it just requires careful implementation. I one time considered writing a tool that would allow you to store data on a USB drive in a plausibly deniable fashion, and made some good progress. I ended up abandoning it though for various reasons (one of them being that I was using Free Pascal to write the program, which turned out to be a bad choice given my lack of skill with Pascal.)</p>
<p>I’ve heard some people claim that if you use LUKS with a detached header and store the header on another drive, the drive containing the LUKS volume itself is now plausibly deniable. I have not verified this myself, and there’s an obvious problem with this, which you yourself mention:</p>

<p>Are luks encrypted system drive with external boot and header suspicious ?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Yes. To decrypt the LUKS volume, you have to have a copy of the header, which means you have to store the LUKS header for the drive <em>somewhere</em>. If someone abducts you and takes your laptop, they’re probably also going to take any removable media you have, and if they find your LUKS header file on one of those drives, they can now prove that you’re using drive encryption <em>somewhere</em>. If your internal drive looks like random noise, then they can be pretty sure that the LUKS header corresponds to that drive. If they find an entire <em>boot partition</em> on the same drive, they can be even more certain.</p> ]]></description>

What do you mean by “temporarily” resolved. Do you have a clue why /boot/efi/EFI/boot/grub.cfg was missing?</p> ]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>This boot issue happens after you shut down and then boot Kicksecure after a few tries. You can copy  grub.cfg to the boot folder which temporarily resolves the issue but if you have secure boot on, Kicksecure would refuse to boot.</p> ]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>Thanks again for bothering! I updated my EC/Bios and did a <code>cp /boot/efi/EFI/Kicksecure/grub.cfg /boot/efi/EFI/boot/grub.cfg</code>.<br>
One or the other did make a difference!<br>
When choosing ‘UEFI: USB, Partition 1’ to boot from, it now actually boots, instead ending up with the Grub cmd line.<br>
So it seems your advice did the trick! Thank you <a class="mention" href="https://forums.kicksecure.com/u/arraybolt3">@arraybolt3</a> for your time!<br>
The question remains why <code>/boot/efi/EFI/boot/grub.cfg</code> wasn’t there in the first place.</p> ]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>That looks <em>mostly</em> right… except there should be a <code>grub.cfg</code> file under <code>/boot/efi/EFI/boot</code>. Why that isn’t there is a mystery to me. Could you try <code>sudo cp /boot/efi/EFI/Kicksecure/grub.cfg /boot/efi/EFI/boot/grub.cfg</code> and see if that resolves the issue?</p>
<p>(Note: Do <strong>NOT</strong> copy <code>/boot/grub/grub.cfg</code>, that is the wrong file. EFI systems use <em>two</em> grub.cfg files, you want the one currently residing at <code>/boot/efi/EFI/Kicksecure/grub.cfg</code>.)</p> ]]></description>

        <title>Unallocated space</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@arraybolt3]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>I don’t know the exact reason for this unallocated space currently, however I highly suspect it’s because of how the GUID Partition Table (GPT) disk structure works. Disks that are GPT-partitioned have <em>two</em> partition tables, a primary one at the start of the drive, and a backup one at the very end of the drive. The GPT table is about 16 kilobytes in size.</p>
<p>It’s also possible this is related to partition alignment - disks perform faster if you make sure that partitions start and end at particular locations on the disk, and sometimes a little bit of free space has to be left in order to make that happen.</p>
<p>It is extremely unlikely any unencrypted data would leak into the unallocated portions of the disk. There’s no reason for the LUKS code to write unencrypted data anywhere except volatile memory (i.e. RAM), and it would be a fatal security flaw for it to do so. There are also all sorts of problems that would occur with code that wrote data into unallocated disk space by design (i.e. what would the code do if there wasn’t unallocated space to use, or what about disks where the unallocated space actually <em>is</em> used, for instance by the system bootloader?), so it would be pointless, insecure, and a usability nightmare for LUKS to do that.</p> ]]></description>

<p>I’ve  comprehensible read the whole documentation about FDE.</p>
<p>Full means the whole drive should be used  without exception .</p>
<p>Maybe even FDE data could be leak into unallocated space</p>
<p>For example,</p>
<p>Debian Luks on LVM  results in non creation of free space  luks2.</p>
<p>Debian live calamares installer also won’t create free space luks1  if i remember.</p>
<p>I will test another install options on debian without lvm and see how it works.</p> ]]></description>

<p>Would require a developer contributing to calamares (and maybe by extension to partitioning tools and whatnot). This might be difficult digging into partitioning stuff. Might even not be calamares issue but general partitioning issues.</p>
