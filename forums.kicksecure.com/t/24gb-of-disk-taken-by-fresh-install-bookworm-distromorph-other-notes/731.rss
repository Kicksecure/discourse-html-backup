    <title>24GB of disk taken by fresh install Bookworm distromorph? + other notes</title>
    <link>https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/24gb-of-disk-taken-by-fresh-install-bookworm-distromorph-other-notes/731</link>
    <description>Downloaded and verified Debian bookworm ISO.
dd if=offed it to a usb stick.
Installed Debian xfce to my laptops 80GB ssd. 
Distromorphed Kicksecure following these instructions:

trafotin com v kicksecure

When starting first time to the desktop the Disks application says 24GB used?

This cant be normal. Could some kicksecures memory security features cause this?


Sidenotes: 
-Installed tor browser bundle, which has now started suggesting browsing history in address bar after starting tor browser. (Computer was powered on just prior to starting tor browser.) All browsing history settings are off and tor browser default settings should prevent any browsing history carry on from previous instanses. Just mentioning this if it is related to other funnybusiness. Posting this to tor forum also. Search about it gave very little.


-Is it ok to install OpenSnitch on Kicksecure. Would like to see who is calling where. I have been using it as a comforting passifier or excuse, for years for not delving deeper into firewall and ip-taples cringe.


-CD/DVD wont play. VLC player gives error message:


-There was no calculator in applications? Installed Gnome Calculator myself.

Otherwise all is sweet so far.

Thank you for all the great work and effort you have put into this.</description>

            <p>I think you are correct.</p>
<p>sudo du -sh /var/swapfile     says:</p>
<p>15G     /var/swapfile</p>
<p>How much diskspace is Bookworm Kicksecure distromorph taking?<br>
There is still 9G unaccounted for. Ill use the baobab for that.</p>
<p>Have to study the thing. Know nothing about those swap files.<br>
Thank you for the links.</p>

            <p>The disk space analyser command (df -h) that was the first of its kind in the additional sowtware list you linked says:</p>
<p>df -h<br>
/dev/mapper/user–vg-root     Size 72G Used 41G</p>
<p>Of which 17G is in one folder on the desktop, where everything I have transfered to the computer since day one is located, except few self installed programs. So there is 24 G of something in the root, like there was when I logged first time to the desktop.</p>
<p>Can I somehow df -h myself deeper in to the root to reveal the bloating culprit?</p>
