    <title>Are Tor hidden services on Kicksecure safe against entry-guard attacks?</title>
    <link>https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/are-tor-hidden-services-on-kicksecure-safe-against-entry-guard-attacks/638</link>
    <description>Hi, I am making this topic because I am curious about the current safety status of using Kicksecure to run a Tor hidden service under default configurations, and what mitigations against entry-guard attacks are currently recommended and supported, if any.

I understand that Tor itself is baked-in with Vanguards Lite, but unless I am misunderstanding the documentation, this is not appropriate for a hidden service that is intended to be active for more than one month. (I would provide this documentation for review, but the board will not let me post a link).

From searches on the Whonix forums, I have seen it suggested to downgrade Tor and then re-enable Vanguards? (Again, I can&#39;t include the link to this...)

Is this correct, and are there any special requirements for re-enabling Vanguards or does it simply need to be installed and enabled via systemctl?

Thanks.</description>
