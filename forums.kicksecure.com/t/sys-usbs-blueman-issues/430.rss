    <title>Sys-usb&#39;s blueman issues</title>
    <link>https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/sys-usbs-blueman-issues/430</link>
    <description>Hey,

I&#39;ve switched my disp sys-usb to kicksecure min template(also disp) with blueman package.
All went good and I could use right away my sys-usb as I would before, except, after a restart, when I start blueman manager(bluetooth manager) and the popup come up with confirmation to auto start bluetooth or not(same as beforehand), when I click on either option(yes/no) the applet just insta crushing and obviously not usable.
Switching back to regular DVM solves the issue, but obviously I want to switch to kicksecure.
Anything you can suggest please?</description>
