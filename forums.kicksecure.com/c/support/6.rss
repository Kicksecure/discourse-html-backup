            <p>Hi all, I realize changing the default <code>umask</code> only has limited benefit, but nonetheless I would like to set it to <code>077</code>.</p>
<p>I’ve tried everything I can think of - all the profile config files in my home directory, the login defaults configuration file, etc, yet nothing seems to work.</p>
<p>What am I missing? TIA</p>

          <title>Ansible task for Kicksecure increasing attack surface?</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[Harisfromcyber]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Support</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I recently took an interest in moving to a hardened debian-based distro and Kicksecure felt like the best option for me. I wanted to automate the installation of it by creating an Ansible task for it that can make it easy to install, as I have a playbook for Debian. Here are the bash commands I use around the playbook:</p>
<pre data-code-wrap="bash"><code class="lang-bash"># Add /sbin to path to for user include its binaries in command line
export PATH=/sbin:$PATH
# User does not have sudo access, so switch to root
su root #`su` could be used, as it assumes root by default
# Adduser to sudo group
adduser user sudo
# Manually add user to sudo group (sudoers) by adding them under root and copying the same permissions as root
## Required since just adding user to sudo group doesn't seem to give user sudo command access
sudo visudo 
# Exit from root
exit
# Install git and Ansible
sudo apt install git ansible -y
# Download the repository
git clone [repo_here]
# Change Directory into the repo
cd ansible
# Install Roles from Ansible Galaxy
ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml
# Run the playbook
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini Debian.yml -K 
#Reboot to finalize changes
reboot
</code></pre>
<p>By doing the setup with the commands above, am I increasing the attack surface since I am not doing it exactly how it is written on the Debian+Kicksecure steps? After install, other than being asked to remove “gnome-calculator”, I seem to be passing the systemcheck. I do understand that Debian-morphed-to-Kicksecure steps are there for a reason, and this is a niche support request. However, if there is no issue doing it this way, I would like to either submit this to documentation and/or just make it public for anyone to use.</p>
<p>P.S. Ansible task for context:</p>
<pre data-code-wrap="YAML"><code class="lang-YAML">---

            <p>So the way I installed Kicksecure was without granting root rights to user to lock it down better.<br>
How can I make it so user can still do upgrade-nonroot without adding user to the sudo group?</p>
<p>Would changing the permissions to the <code>upgrade-nonroot</code> and <code>apt-get-update-plus</code> achieve this?</p>
<p><code>chmod 755 /usr/bin/upgrade-nonroot</code></p>
<p><code>chmod 755 /usr/bin/apt-get-update-plus</code></p>
<p>Would this be a stupid idea? (just want to be able to use user to update/upgrade not install packages)</p>

The <code>user</code> already have too much privileges and I want to avoid from using it.<br>

sudo apt install --no-install-recommends kicksecure-cli-vm<br>
Reading package lists… Done<br>
Building dependency tree… Done<br>
Reading state information… Done<br>
Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have<br>
requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable<br>
distribution that some required packages have not yet been created<br>
or been moved out of Incoming.<br>
The following information may help to resolve the situation:</p>
<p>The following packages have unmet dependencies:<br>
kicksecure-recommended-cli : Depends: libblockdev-crypto2 but it is not installable<br>
plymouth : Conflicts: console-common but 0.7.91 is to be installed<br>
: Error, pkgProblemResolver::Resolve generated breaks, this may be caused by held packages.</p>
<p>Already tried and searched for many solutions, but none of them really solved my problem. Someone can help me?</p>

            <p>Hi,<br>
I think LKRG is signing their <code>tar</code> package now. Can we leave LKRG there and keep packaging it in the future Kicksecure release?</p>

            <p>Is there anyone using or tried to use Kicksecure to run Openstack? How is Kicksecure working with Openstack components? Are they working fine? Please share your experience with it!<br>
I was looking for a security oriented Debian-based distro as my Linux server to host Openstack undercloud, overcloud and guest VM as servers for our service. I just want to know your experience on working with it as a server.<br>
Thanks!</p>

            <p>How do I install a minimal Kicksecure environment? I don’t need Tor, fonts or xserver but <code>kicksecure-cli</code> force me to install a lot of unnecessary packages. Is there anyway that allows me to install a minimal Kicksecure environment? I also don’t need swap at all, why it creates a swap partition for me?<br>
I think we need a <code>kicksecure-minimum</code> metapackage without Tor, fonts or any thing like <code>p7zip</code> or <code>libgtk</code>.</p>

            <p>Hi all,<br>
I installed these packages on my Debian 12 VirtualBox VM: <code>lkrg* ufw hardened-runtime hardened-malloc-kicksecure-enable hardened-malloc apparmor-utils apparmor-profiles-kicksecure* sandbox-app-luncher</code> and everything works fine.<br>
After I checked everything is working after reboot, I rebooted it again and installed <code>security-misc</code> and both of my network interfaces goes down. Please help me!</p>
