            <p>I morphed Kali xfce and Parrot Mate into Kicksecure. All main functions work (some issues arise only during package updates, which need to be resolved manually). This could turn hacker Linux distributions into a powerful weapon (but I’m not sure that devs approve of this). User has all restrictions in live-mode: password prompt, sudo limitations, and no autologin for user. In standard Kicksecure, user has root privileges without password and auto-login in live-mode. I just shared my experience.</p>

How do I enable SMT and SMP for my Intel Processor server?<br>
I have latest BIOS updated, does that mean I am immunity to Meltdown and Spectre and safe to enable SMT?<br>
I need both of my processors to be working, I need SMP to be enabled.<br>
Thank you!</p>

            <p>How do I set a password for any sudo commands in the user profile? So that sudo always asks for a password. <code>sudo passwd user</code> and <code>sudo delgroup user sudo</code> not help. I can use <code>sudo -i -u root</code> without a password. I couldn’t find the right command or instruction. Thanks</p>

          <title>No profile choice nor password use after update &amp; no Live Mode choice at boot</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[jnd]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Support</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hello everyone and thank you in advance for your help!</p>
<p>I installed a few months ago Kicksecure on Debian 12 and everything was working fine except since a recent update performed with sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt full-upgrade -y.<br>
Before this one, after the boot procedure I arrived on the window where to choose my login, I entered my profile name and password and arrived on the desktop. Now, after booting, I arrive directly on the desktop of a profile that is “user” without a password, and I have to log out to return to the choice window and enter my login and password to use my usual profile.<br>
Furthermore, after boot and automatic connection without login, I opened a browser which automatically displayed the /wiki/Live_Mode page and I saw that at boot I don’t have the choice of Live Mode.<br>
I don’t understand what’s happened and despite my research I haven’t found how to restore the profile choice window after boot, nor how to have the Live Mode choice at boot.<br>
Your advice is most welcome!<br>
JND</p>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hello, I am following the <code>Install Kicksecure inside Debian</code> documenation and had a few questions. I am aiming to install the <code>Kicksecure CLI package</code> on a <code>Debian-12-minimal</code> template for reference.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Which installation method would be considered generally safer, <code>Using extrepo</code> or <code>Manually</code>?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why is <code>--no-install-recommends</code> not used when installing <code>extrepo</code>? It also is not used when installing <code>apt-transport-tor</code> when using the manual method. Why is this the case?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are these following steps necessary when installing on Qubes? If so, why?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>5.</strong> Create group <code>console</code>.</p>
<p><code>/usr/sbin/addgroup --system console</code></p>
<p><strong>6.</strong> Add your Linux account user name to group <code>console</code>.</p>
<p>Note: Replace user <code>user</code> with your actual user name.</p>
<p><code>/usr/sbin/adduser user console</code></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>What is the difference between <code>/usr/sbin/adduser user sudo</code> and installing <code>qubes-core-agent-passwordless-root</code>? Do they achieve the exact same result?</li>
</ul>

          <title>Include whonix installer with Kicksecure Live ISO?</title>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Would it be possible to include the Whonix gateway and workstation with the Live ISO?<br>
Currently the Live ISO size is only 1.3 GB and is pretty bare and leaves alot of room for much more.</p>
<p>Most USB’s are 16GB and up and most physical CD/DVD’s are 4.5 or 8.5GB.<br>
The sad thing there is no Live distros that come with Virtual Machine software that you can use live or are not maintained anymore.</p>
<p>It would be great if the Live ISO came with whonix gateway &amp; workstation and VM’s software. So not only would Kicksecure ISO have an installer it would also serve utility of being a Live USB that has whonix and virtualization software included.</p>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hi. Sorry, I am very beginner to Linux OS, but I have spent 6 hours today and was not able to figure this out.</p>
<p><strong>Some INFO:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>So, I installed Kicksecure from Kicksecure ISO following this guide kicksecure . com/wiki/ISO and pressed “Install to hardrive” and installed it to my SSD. During installation my internet cable from my home router was plugged in (dunno if that matters)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is the problem?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>After installation finished, I booted the Kicksecure OS and everything seem to work, except my internet from my Ethernet cable.<br>
Note: I tried plugging a wireless card and the internet would instantly work via WIFI (after plugging i did apt-get update &amp;&amp; upgrade). Also, on other OS on same PC, my internet through cable would work instantly. I guess that it is something with Kicksecure settings that is not working for me.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I do?</strong><br>
Well since I am a noob I was searching and trying different suggested ideas, mainly from Debian 12 (bookworm).</p>
<ul>
<li>First thing i noticed I did not have /etc/network/interfaces so I tried creating that with different settings like:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

auto eth0
allow-hotplug eth0
iface eth0 inet dhcp
</code></pre>
<p>that only made my “Ethernet: wired connection 1” disappear in my nm-connection-editor. So, I removed that and started searching again.Then I read all of this forums.whonix . org/t/kicksecure-network-configuration/8985/52 and my head started to hurt. But what i understood (and maybe that is wrong) that network on Kicksecure is configured in their own unique way, not like Debian 12 /etc/network/interfaces. That realization did not help me much tho. I then noticed my connection did not have any IPv4, only IPv6. So I tried manually imagining what my IP could look like if it was static, since usually everything is DHCP. So I tried adding in my NetworkManager Applet</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">IP Address: 192.168.1.15
Netmask: 255.255.255.0
Gateway: 192.168.1.254
DNS servers: 192.168.1.254 (also tried 8.8.8.8)
</code></pre>
<p>All that did was - that instead of <code>ping 8.8.8.8 Network unreachable </code> I started getting</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">PING 8.8.8.8 (8.8.8.8) 58 (84) bytes of data.
From 192.168.1.15 icmp_seq=1 Destination Host Unreachable
</code></pre>
<p>Which as you can probably now tell was a progress for me. Anyway, but I am kinda stuck here and don’t know what to do. Here is how my ifconfig -a  looks like:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">[user ~]% ifconfig -a 
eth0: flags=4163&lt;UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST&gt;  mtu 1500
        inet 192.168.1.15  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 192.168.1.255

        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0
</code></pre>
<p>Also I dont understand how to restart my network in Kicksecure, I tried:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">sudo systemctl restart networking
sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart
/usr/bin/systemctl restart networking
sudo service networking restart
</code></pre>
<p>but nothing seems to worked, so I had to reboot my OS after yet another “new brilliant idea” that i had <img src="https://forums.kicksecure.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"> that what hell looks like xD especially with Luks encryption -.-</p>

            <p>Hi all, I realize changing the default <code>umask</code> only has limited benefit, but nonetheless I would like to set it to <code>077</code>.</p>
<p>I’ve tried everything I can think of - all the profile config files in my home directory, the login defaults configuration file, etc, yet nothing seems to work.</p>
<p>What am I missing? TIA</p>

          <title>Ansible task for Kicksecure increasing attack surface?</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[Harisfromcyber]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Support</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I recently took an interest in moving to a hardened debian-based distro and Kicksecure felt like the best option for me. I wanted to automate the installation of it by creating an Ansible task for it that can make it easy to install, as I have a playbook for Debian. Here are the bash commands I use around the playbook:</p>
<pre data-code-wrap="bash"><code class="lang-bash"># Add /sbin to path to for user include its binaries in command line
export PATH=/sbin:$PATH
# User does not have sudo access, so switch to root
su root #`su` could be used, as it assumes root by default
# Adduser to sudo group
adduser user sudo
# Manually add user to sudo group (sudoers) by adding them under root and copying the same permissions as root
## Required since just adding user to sudo group doesn't seem to give user sudo command access
sudo visudo 
# Exit from root
exit
# Install git and Ansible
sudo apt install git ansible -y
# Download the repository
git clone [repo_here]
# Change Directory into the repo
cd ansible
# Install Roles from Ansible Galaxy
ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml
# Run the playbook
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini Debian.yml -K 
#Reboot to finalize changes
reboot
</code></pre>
<p>By doing the setup with the commands above, am I increasing the attack surface since I am not doing it exactly how it is written on the Debian+Kicksecure steps? After install, other than being asked to remove “gnome-calculator”, I seem to be passing the systemcheck. I do understand that Debian-morphed-to-Kicksecure steps are there for a reason, and this is a niche support request. However, if there is no issue doing it this way, I would like to either submit this to documentation and/or just make it public for anyone to use.</p>
<p>P.S. Ansible task for context:</p>
<pre data-code-wrap="YAML"><code class="lang-YAML">---
