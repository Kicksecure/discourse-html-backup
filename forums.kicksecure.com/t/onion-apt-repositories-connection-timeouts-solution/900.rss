    <title>Onion APT repositories connection timeouts solution?</title>
    <link>https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/onion-apt-repositories-connection-timeouts-solution/900</link>
    <description>Tor onion APT repositories can sometimes fail when updating. This can can happen due to the slowness of generated onion circuits or having a custom `/etc/tor/torrc` can cause them to timeout when updating.

In fact the Tails project since 6.4 removed the onion Debian repositories

&gt; Switch to using HTTPS addresses instead of an onion addresses for the Debian and Tails APT repositories. This makes the Additional Software feature more reliable.
&gt;&gt; https://tails.net/news/version_6.4/index.en.html

I created a config `/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/99timeout`

(15 seconds till timeout, 5 seconds till retry, and retries 3 times.)

```
Acquire::http::Timeout &quot;15&quot;;
Acquire::http::Retry-After &quot;5&quot;;
Acquire::Retries &quot;3&quot;;
```

I&#39;m not sure how the integration tor and APT works but this would only effect http repos which also are what onions are.

This configuration seemed to work for me but I&#39;m not sure if this fix is placebo?

In closing I don&#39;t think Kicksecure should follow the same route of removing Onion repositories or Onion Debian repositories as thats one thing i strongly disagree with choice of the other project.</description>
