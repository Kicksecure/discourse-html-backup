            <p>Hi. help me how to change zsh theme? I have .zsh file which I used in previous linux distribution. if this file replaces default .zsh in /home/user/ then only header changes. default zsh is empty (like on github). I am not advanced user and I can not find file which is responsible for commands color scheme. I found that color scheme is connected with desktop-config-dist package, but I do not understand what file is responsible for zsh colors. if I delete desktop-config-dist then other packages are also deleted - I would not like to do that. I will be grateful for help</p>

            <p>Thank you. This is a great solution.<br>
But system check always show:<br>
WARNING: Debian Package Update Check Result: apt-get reports that packages can be updated.<br>
Please update this machine:<br>
(Open a terminal, Start Menu → System → Terminal.)<br>
upgrade-nonroot<br>
Even if system is update. I checked it on my computer and a friend’s computer - always this message. Could you please change it so that this warning appears when there are non-updated packages only?</p>

            <p>Hi, I need to make openvswitch to work on Kicksecure! After I bridge my NIC I can’t connect to internet anymore. I can’t ping anything on the same subnet. I executed <code>arp</code> command and it founds every other machine on the same subnet but the hwaddress(mac address of other machine on the subnet boardcast)  are showing “(incomeplete)”. Please help me!</p>

            <p>Timely system updates are very important for security. It is very convenient to have notifications about new updates on desktop/panel. This is perfectly implemented in mint, mx and other distros. Many users do not check updates - one of my friends installed Kicksecure and has not updated system for a long time. He thought that there were no new updates. Such tool in new versions of Kicksecure would add convenience and security to users.<br>
Thank you</p>

            <p>Sdwdate wont connect. I cant update and upgrade Kicksecure either.<br>
Tor browser works fine though.<br>
Sdwdate started doing this recently.<br>
Yesterday sdwdate just finally worked for some reason.<br>
Today I have restarted it every 5-10 minutes for the last 2 hours in hope of resurrecting it.</p>
<p>Update/upgrade command times out while waiting response from proxys.<br>
Synaptic Package Manager wont connect either.<br>
also System Check program cant connect to Tor for Tor Bootstrap test.</p>
<p>So why browser connects, but rest of the toys wont?</p>

            <p>How do you use Kicksecure yourself? Do you think Kicksecure is the most secure host OS (or the most secure Debian OS?) or do you use it in a VM, with host Fedora, NixOS, Alpine, openSuse, Qubes…? The developers’ experience is very important and interesting. After all, you’ve studied many Linux distributions and are creating Kicksecure based on the experience of using other systems. I’m interested in your opinion at the end of 2024. And what do you think about using Nix manager in Kicksecure? What do you think about using distrobox with podman to install packages in Alpine, Fedora or other secure distros?</p>

            <p>Hello, I wanted to create a VM on virt-manager but I noticed that it offers me 16 cpu instead of 32 because I have 2 processors of 16 threads. After some research I saw that kicksecure had indeed found 32 threads but that half of them are disabled, so I tried to enable them manually by going through the sys folder but I have no right to modify the /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/online file. How can I fix this? Thanks in advance</p>

            <p>I’ve been using Whonix which is based on Kicksecure for many years but I just got a new PC and now I’m having problems booting it in VirtualBox. I tried posting this on the Whonix forums but they suggested I ask here.</p>
<p>Sometimes it will boot correctly and sometimes it will get stuck. I’m often seeing strange errors/warnings around where it gets stuck which could be related. Unfortunately this forum won’t allow me to post a link or upload an image.</p>
<p>The errors seem to refer to the CPU so it might be worth mentioning I have an AMD Ryzen 7 9800x3d which has only just come out recently. Is there a known issue with this CPU?</p>

            <p>hi. my girlfriend installed morphing kicksecure on debian xfce and her pure-vpn stopped working - can’t connect to server. it looks like these are problems due to dns changes. how to return default dns settings or what package to delete so that kicksecure doesn’t interfere with dns? i tried to delete several packages, but to no avail. only timeshift solves problem - a return to default debian. i use nordvpn and mullvad - there is no such problem.</p>

            <p>Downloaded and verified Debian bookworm ISO.<br>
dd if=offed it to a usb stick.<br>
Installed Debian xfce to my laptops 80GB ssd.<br>
Distromorphed Kicksecure following these instructions:</p>
<p>trafotin com v kicksecure</p>
<p>When starting first time to the desktop the Disks application says 24GB used?</p>
<p>This cant be normal. Could some kicksecures memory security features cause this?</p>
<p>Sidenotes:<br>
-Installed tor browser bundle, which has now started suggesting browsing history in address bar after starting tor browser. (Computer was powered on just prior to starting tor browser.) All browsing history settings are off and tor browser default settings should prevent any browsing history carry on from previous instanses. Just mentioning this if it is related to other funnybusiness. Posting this to tor forum also. Search about it gave very little.</p>
<p>-Is it ok to install OpenSnitch on Kicksecure. Would like to see who is calling where. I have been using it as a comforting passifier or excuse, for years for not delving deeper into firewall and ip-taples cringe.</p>
<p>-CD/DVD wont play. VLC player gives error message:</p>
<p>-There was no calculator in applications? Installed Gnome Calculator myself.</p>
<p>Otherwise all is sweet so far.</p>
<p>Thank you for all the great work and effort you have put into this.</p>

          <title>How to stop writing my ISO&#39;s as Rock Ridge/Joliet</title>

            <p>Edit: I may have included too much additional information, I tried to provide enough data so others that have experienced this or may experience it in the future are able to locate this thread through search engines and hopefully get a resolution the issue.</p>
<p>This gets called anytime I download an ISO and I can’t figure out how to make it stop. Its able to replace the freshly downloaded ISO with the Rock Ridge version instantaneously before I could even run a dd command or launch disk image writer to get the fresh ISO written to disk before it is modified.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>I don’t think I’m on the real Kicksecure anymore. A lot of things that shouldn’t be enabled by default are enabled like the bluetooth.service, overlayfs, fuse, and ntfs3g are also enabled. My xdg-user-dirs is normally /home/user/.config I think, it has been changed to point to /usr/bin/share/, that way I load flatpaks from the wrong directory just like the flatpak escape 0day did.</p>
<p>The doocumentation (man pages for example) aren’t even the same and my grub menu shows that lines have been removed, there is a new line added that is a if fi statement to insert two more kernel modules named lzopio and xen (I think that’s the name of them, very close if not). It seems like the lower deck of the overlayfs  is hooking into upper deck with some malicious binaries and shared objects, deleting anything hooked into the upper deck causes a crash, the lower deck is all lib32 software running on a squashfs.img and its dependencies get mangled in with my own, I have to download SSH libs for apps that don’t require networking to function or other random packages that should not be dependencies. I also have to delete the boot order using efitbootmgr and modify my grub entry in order to actually boot into the system at the lower deck. Even figuring out how to boot into the lower deck of the system doesn’t solve the problem though unfortunately.</p>
<p>It’s not as simple as reformatting my USB drive and secure erasing my SSD then using a fresh ISO, it’s like the data doesn’t really get wiped from the USB even though it appears that way to software like gparted and gnome-disks reading the disk image. I have wiped it then brought it over to a remote location, away from my potentially infected machine and it still manages to write that same ISO with the overlayfs and Rock Ridge ISO.</p>
<p>So, what I’m trying to get at as is, has anyone dealt with this before? What can I do aside from considering my devices trashed? I’m strongly considering dumping this data publicly out of frustration but something doesn’t feel right about doing that, somebody certainly put a lot of time and effort into devoping and writing documentation for this system.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the man pages and python documentation are not standard, almost all of the binaries serve an alternate purpose than their name would lead you to believe, for example I can run ‘gpic FILENAME &gt; OUTPUT.txt’ and deobfuscate data hidden inside of files. There is a man page for GNUstep (if I recall correctly) that’s as long as novel and it goes into detail about how to write code in order to cause a buffer overflow in the kernel. So sharing something like that publicly seems to me like I would be destroying the hard work of someone or some group of individuals who have put a lot of time into it. As much I hate what they did to me, I’m also in awe of their work and complexity of the system at the same time.</p>
<p>Is this a known thing that others are getting attacked with in the wild, is it more likely a targeted attack and not wide spread? Locally it seems to spread like a worm via usb and through the network, the boot loader they force me to boot from contains a kernel for Windows, Mac, and Linux (version 5.1, unsupported and out of date), so even switching operating systems does not solve the problem. I hope someone can provide a solution that doesn’t involve throwing my machine into the dump.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am setting up SMB or wanting to. Now I have a GLinet Flint 2 router and it seems very basic to setup but I am running into issues. Is there something to install on either the router or in KickSecure? I thought this would be a easy setup.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I’ve been using Kicksecure and it’s derivatives for a good while by now in Qubes VMs and on servers (Kicksecure in Qubes and on server is morphed, Whonix 17 templates are official Qubes templates) and just realized that I have a seemingly plain, unencrypted swap partition on all Qubes templates. The morphed version on the server host looks correct, if I am not mistaken. Reading the documentation, my impression is that  <code>swap-file-creator</code> should change this by default on Kicksecure systems.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>

/etc/fstab entry in morphed Debian template on Qubes OS <a href="https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/swap-file-creator-missing-when-in-qubes-templates-morphing-official-derivative-templates/644/1">(click for more details)</a>

/etc/fstab entry in my Whonix-Workstation AppVM installed from the official template on Qubes OS <a href="https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/swap-file-creator-missing-when-in-qubes-templates-morphing-official-derivative-templates/644/1">(click for more details)</a>

Several command outputs from my morphed Kicksecure on a virtual server <a href="https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/swap-file-creator-missing-when-in-qubes-templates-morphing-official-derivative-templates/644/1">(click for more details)</a>
<p>The package is also not installed on any of the machines except for the morphed host (actually a VPS). It looks like I chose <code>kicksecure-qubes-cli</code> for the Kicksecure template on Qubes while morphing and, again, the Whonix templates were not built by myself. On the VPS, I chose <code>kicksecure-cli-host</code>. (Writing this… is there potentially a difference between the <code>host</code> and the <code>qubes</code> packages in regards to the package being installed/not installed?)</p>
<p>Trying to find an answer to this still left me with two related questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the documentation outdated? It states that it should be installed by default: /wiki/Swap-file-creator#Installation (posting the link resulted in an error, sorry)<br>
That said, I don’t know what cases <em><strong>“otherwise”</strong></em> covers or what history, intention or background the sentence has, though.</li>
<li>Is there any other countermeasure against potentially sensitive information being written to the disk via swapping, which I was not able to find in the wiki, or may, for instance, keys have ended up on my disk?</li>
</ul>

            <p>sudo apt install --no-install-recommends kicksecure-xfce-host - Conflict with Plymouth after entering this command when morphing Debian, MX Linux and LMDE. This error was made by me and all my friends. Today, my friend also received it. <em>sudo apt remove plymouth</em> resolves problem. Write about it in morphing instructions so that people know what to do in this situation. It seems that someone has complained about this error on this forum</p>
