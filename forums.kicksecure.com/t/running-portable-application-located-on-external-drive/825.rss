    <title>Running portable application located on external drive</title>
    <link>https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/running-portable-application-located-on-external-drive/825</link>
    <description>Browser (Brave &amp; Tor) were downloaded and extracted to a external folder which is mounted on /mnt. These tools are installed for portability as I do not use KickSecure only. 

They work outside of KickSecure, which got me questioning...

What&#39;s the catch ?</description>

            <p>If the OS has malware that is running as root / administrator / SYSTEM / some other highly privileged user account depending on the particular OS you’re working with, then yes. Read-only flags are enforced in software only, and anything with high privileges on a system can turn off or even just ignore those flags. So if you’re going to do this, you should only share the drive between systems you trust to not have malware on them.</p>

            <p>What I’m trying to achieve is to run brave browser &amp; tor browser which I’ve downloaded from the official source. They’re both located in /mnt/brave and /mnt/tor respectively with permission code 0655.</p>
<p>I’ve tried running tor browser but got lots of permission denied error, fed up and deleted the whole partition. Well I think I’m calm enough to learn what have I done wrong. <em>Yeah, just ignore me deleting the whole partition. Will download and set them up properly later</em></p>

<p>Sharing programs with different operating systems? Then any malware infection could travel to each.</p>
