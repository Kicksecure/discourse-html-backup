    <title>GrapheneOS Attacks Kicksecure! What should the response be?</title>

    <description>I do not know what the correct forum category is to post this. I presume that this category is okay? Please move the topic if there is a better forum category for it.

&gt; Kicksecure is awful. Has a horrible choice of base OS for security and they don&#39;t do valuable work to improve it. They sabotaged security efforts and are spreading misinformation about allocator hardening and other topics they don&#39;t understand.
&gt; 
&gt; Secureblue is doing useful work.
&gt; 
&gt; The concept used by Whonix for forcing traffic through Tor makes sense but the OS has awful security, just like the Tor Browser itself having awful security. Someone making an equivalent out of Fedora Silverblue or Arch would obsolete it.
&gt; 
&gt; Kicksecure/Whonix doesn&#39;t do any significant hardening and the efforts to do that were stalled and then rolled back when the person responsible for most of it left the project. It has some minor anonymity changes easily done elsewhere. Encrypted swap is widely used elsewhere.


Presumably, you all disagree with Daniel Micay / GrapheneOS. What is the rebuttal here?

Thank you for your responses.</description>
