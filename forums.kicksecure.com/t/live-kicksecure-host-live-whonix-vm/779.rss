    <description>**Live** **Kicksecure with Live VM**

A live Kicksecure host cannot run a VM.

Is it possible to develop a fully *stateless* system that would function with a live Kicksecure host running a live Whonix VM (set to Immutable in Virtual Box)?

See image of error message here:
-- drive. proton. me /urls/   ATVJSDRBS0#2L5gpa2yNrUJ
-- drive. proton. me /urls/   PMZPCBGZA0#j0B4BZFjRiAx

(FYI, KVM seems the more secure virtualization technology to me since I have seen Oracle’s software crash many times on Fedora hosts. But I understand the Company’s expertise can come in handy from time to time.)



**********

A few additional security observations:

‘**hardened-kernel**’ is a highly appreciated feature in Kicksecure.
wiki/Hardened-kernel
Other software is far more susceptible to kernel crashes. For example, both Qubes (Fedora Dom0) and Graphene OS have observable soft-spots in their kernel and it would be very unfortunate if one stored a wallet with Amethyst, etc (Android) or in a weak Fedora host. Building Mobian on Pine64 towards a mobile Kicksecure spin would be awesome for secure mobile crypto wallets that could interact with POS IRL

+ virtualization not strong - i.e. rpc and qrexec really all connected

**Native sandboxing**  like Firejail is also a good place to direct one’s efforts in developing Kicksecure. https:/  /www.  kicksecure. com/wiki/Sandbox-app-launcher
After extensive testing, it would appear that the MAC control and permission hardening paradigm of TAILS is stronger than the compartmentalization and isolation through virtualization strategy of Qubes OS.

**Dual Strength Tor Level** options – If one takes a look at Nym (Chaum mixnet - Free Haven whitepapers) VPN, you can see that there is a Wireguard level and a mixnet level for secure messaging and confidential layer blockchain. I would recommend something similar if not handled on an app-by-app basis for levels of tor: *one layer with Vanguards* and another *layer for low-latency* tor.

**Kloak** - keystroke anonymization is also a very interesting Kicksecure feature under development that is not offered in any other major distribution.</description>
