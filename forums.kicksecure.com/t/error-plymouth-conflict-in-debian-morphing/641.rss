    <description>sudo apt install --no-install-recommends kicksecure-xfce-host - Conflict with Plymouth after entering this command when morphing Debian, MX Linux and LMDE. This error was made by me and all my friends. Today, my friend also received it. *sudo apt remove plymouth* resolves problem. Write about it in morphing instructions so that people know what to do in this situation. It seems that someone has complained about this error on this forum</description>

</aside>
<p>I think you meant to say debian mx linux and LMDE (which is mint debian based project).</p>
<p>These are unsupported projects out of the box, what we support morphing is pure/plain debian stable.</p>
<p>(both of these projects dont give a damn about security, thus you might find some issues like this one you are facing)</p>

            <p>How did you install Debian?</p>
<ul>
<li>Debian Live, Clamares?</li>
<li>Using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian-Installer" class="inline-onebox">Debian-Installer - Wikipedia</a>? Which option / desktop environment did you choose?</li>
</ul>
<p>I am asking, so we can reproduce this.</p>

            <p>Do you know if we can safely suggest <code>sudo apt purge plymouth</code> in context of distribution morphing?</p>
<p>Does Debian break after reboot without that package installed?</p>
<p>Any issues if using full disk encryption? (Does it break the full disk encryption pre-boot authentication password prompt?)</p>
<p>Or would we need to suggest <code>sudo apt install console-common</code> at the same time?</p>

            <p>What is plymouth used for… is it really needed for the splash screen?<br>
Slick Greeter should be looked into for the greeter login screen shipped with Kicksecure.<br>
It is what comes with Linux Mint however it does not come bundled with the Cinnamon desktop environment itself. So if other DE shipped ISO’s for Kicksecure where to be released like with Cinnamon it wouldn’t come included.</p>
<p><strong>Slick Greeter</strong> (slick-greeter) does not require Plymouth. Slick Greeter is a lightweight GTK+ greeter for LightDM, and it is primarily responsible for providing the graphical login interface. It can function independently of Plymouth.</p>
