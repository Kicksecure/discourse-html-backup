          <title>Swap-file-creator missing when in Qubes templates (morphing &amp; official derivative templates)</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[Crok]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Support</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I’ve been using Kicksecure and it’s derivatives for a good while by now in Qubes VMs and on servers (Kicksecure in Qubes and on server is morphed, Whonix 17 templates are official Qubes templates) and just realized that I have a seemingly plain, unencrypted swap partition on all Qubes templates. The morphed version on the server host looks correct, if I am not mistaken. Reading the documentation, my impression is that  <code>swap-file-creator</code> should change this by default on Kicksecure systems.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>

/etc/fstab entry in morphed Debian template on Qubes OS <a href="https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/swap-file-creator-missing-when-in-qubes-templates-morphing-official-derivative-templates/644/1">(click for more details)</a>

/etc/fstab entry in my Whonix-Workstation AppVM installed from the official template on Qubes OS <a href="https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/swap-file-creator-missing-when-in-qubes-templates-morphing-official-derivative-templates/644/1">(click for more details)</a>

Several command outputs from my morphed Kicksecure on a virtual server <a href="https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/swap-file-creator-missing-when-in-qubes-templates-morphing-official-derivative-templates/644/1">(click for more details)</a>
<p>The package is also not installed on any of the machines except for the morphed host (actually a VPS). It looks like I chose <code>kicksecure-qubes-cli</code> for the Kicksecure template on Qubes while morphing and, again, the Whonix templates were not built by myself. On the VPS, I chose <code>kicksecure-cli-host</code>. (Writing this… is there potentially a difference between the <code>host</code> and the <code>qubes</code> packages in regards to the package being installed/not installed?)</p>
<p>Trying to find an answer to this still left me with two related questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the documentation outdated? It states that it should be installed by default: /wiki/Swap-file-creator#Installation (posting the link resulted in an error, sorry)<br>
That said, I don’t know what cases <em><strong>“otherwise”</strong></em> covers or what history, intention or background the sentence has, though.</li>
<li>Is there any other countermeasure against potentially sensitive information being written to the disk via swapping, which I was not able to find in the wiki, or may, for instance, keys have ended up on my disk?</li>
</ul>

          <title>Are Tor hidden services on Kicksecure safe against entry-guard attacks?</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[NobodyImportant]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Support</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hi, I am making this topic because I am curious about the current safety status of using Kicksecure to run a Tor hidden service under default configurations, and what mitigations against entry-guard attacks are currently recommended and supported, if any.</p>
<p>I understand that Tor itself is baked-in with Vanguards Lite, but unless I am misunderstanding the documentation, this is not appropriate for a hidden service that is intended to be active for more than one month. (I would provide this documentation for review, but the board will not let me post a link).</p>
<p>From searches on the Whonix forums, I have seen it suggested to downgrade Tor and then re-enable Vanguards? (Again, I can’t include the link to this…)</p>
<p>Is this correct, and are there any special requirements for re-enabling Vanguards or does it simply need to be installed and enabled via systemctl?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hi,<br>
I’m using Kicksecure as my OS, not live.</p>
<p>I’m trying to add an alias, so when I modify the ~/.bashrc and then source it I get the following response :</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">/home/user/.bashrc:18: command not found: shopt

<p>It then launches another shell with a weird prompt (last string at the end) where the alias does work, but when I quit and open another terminal the prompt is back to normal and the alias doesn’t work. When I check the .bashrc file the modification are still there.</p>

I installed kicksecure onto usb flash drive following word for word the official installation tutorial to install kicksecure iso to usb flash drive.

            <p>hi friends</p>
<p>I’m very interested in kicksecure and wanted to have it installed on a usb drive to test it longer before installing on hard drive, but i’ve got a serious problem. I can’t have the usb drive running the totally standard install</p>
<p>I run from a ventoy usb with kicksecure 17 iso; and install on another usb drive.<br>
Config is standard : erase complete sdb device, and automatic partitioning</p>
<p>BUT, whether I choose luks crypted or not, the USBN isn’t bootable<br>
a few errors appears before grub shell starts : I reach GNU GRUB version 2.06 etc… minimal bash-like line editing.</p>
<p>errors very briefly appears just before :<br>
<code>error : no such device: /.disk/info.</code><br>
<code>.................''...../.disk/mini-info.</code><br>
<code>.................''...../26adaabd-0000-0000...etc...</code></p>
<p>and then go to gnu grub bash like command line</p>
<p>I don’t know how to get kicksecure installed on the usb, although I keept all the standard ready to go parameters.<br>
I looked on the net, and didn’t find much. The tutorial from kicksecure for installing on a usb is very limited ; i found no indication on partitioning nor on how to manage luks encrypted partitions<br>
I’d be glad to have any indications or help to deal with this, many thanks !</p>

            <h1><a name="p-1221-recommendations-1" class="anchor" href="https://forums.kicksecure.com#p-1221-recommendations-1"></a>Recommendations</h1>
<p>Obviously a generic hostname is advisable, but in practice, there are limited other solutions available at present. One is to turn off any protocols that are not strictly necessary and which leak hostnames, particularly when insecure places are visited. This reduces the attack surface, but is impractical for certain protocols; for example, DHCP is necessary for Internet connectivity and many services depend on protocols such as mDNS. Another option is to use different hostnames for different purposes, rather than relying on a global hostname - this option is available on some OSes. Ultimately, <strong>a randomized hostname protocol is necessary</strong> to protect privacy, similar to methods utilized for MAC addresses.</p>
<p>What is a randomized hostname protocol?<br>
Do kicksecure randomize it?</p>
<p>sudo hostname shows</p>
<p>localhost</p>

            <p>rm -rf/ - this command destroy system in live mode? Or will everything be restored after reboot? I am afraid to try. I was told that if the system is restored, grub-live is very secure. I understand that such a command should not be entered, but if some intruder enters it or I accidentally insert it inattentively</p>

            <p>Hello everybody,<br>
Since my last update of Kicksecure (Morphing on Debian), I have a boot error:<br>
Failed to start swap-file-creator.service.</p>
<p>I’ve looked in the documentation and it seems to me that this is due to the fact that I don’t have enough free space on the part of my hard disk where the programs are installed. I think this swap would like to be created on JNDebian-vg-root.</p>
<p>1K block file system Used Available Uti% Mounted on<br>
udev 3862196 0 3862196 0% /dev<br>
tmpfs 778292 1764 776528 1% /run<br>
/dev/mapper/JNDebian–vg-root 28658596 21430388 5747096 79% /<br>
tmpfs 3891440 226012 3665428 6% /dev/shm<br>
tmpfs 5120 8 5112 1% /run/lock<br>
/dev/nvme0n1p1 465124 70189 370001 16% /boot<br>
/dev/mapper/JNDebian–vg-home 214662440 166803556 36881812 82% /home<br>
none 10240 4 10236 1% /run/msgcollector<br>
tmpfs 778288 84 778204 1% /run/user/1000</p>
<p>Is there a solution either to change the default swap size or to create it on JNDebian-vg-home, which has more free disk space?<br>
Thanks for your help!<br>
Jeronath</p>
