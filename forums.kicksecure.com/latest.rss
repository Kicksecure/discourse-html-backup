          <title>Reducing the risk of installing malicious apt packages?</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[arraybolt3]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Development</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>(Was waiting for a very long software build to finish and this idea popped into my head, so I decided to write it up and post it.)</p>
<p>A distro’s package manager is an interesting potential malware vector for a number of reasons. They are implicitly trusted by the distribution as being a safe source of software. The fact that these repositories are maintained by distributions and don’t simply allow anyone to throw software onto them increases their trustworthiness, and thus increases a user’s likelihood to treat them as entirely safe. Even though I do not (any longer) trust a distro’s official repos to be totally safe, I do generally trust <code>sudo apt install</code> to be more safe than most other ways of obtaining software.</p>
<p>However, while a distro’s repositories are indeed <em>more</em> safe than using the Internet at large as your software repository (thanks Windows for proving that), that doesn’t mean that a package manager is entirely safe:</p>
<ul>
<li>Very little code review is generally done when packaging a software application for several major distributions, including Debian. Debian does not require (or even particularly encourage) packagers to do a code review, and the people who review new packages to ensure they are suitable for inclusion into the Debian archives mostly check that the <em>packaging</em> looks good, not the code of the application. As a result it is very possible for a malicious package to be introduced into the archive on accident. Similarly, it’s possible for malicious code to be introduced into a previously legitimate application without anyone noticing. (This has happened at least twice before, once very notably in the xz-utils incident, and once in a <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/linux-infection-proves-windows-malware-monopoly-is-over-gentoo-ships-backdoor-updated/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">lesser-known backdoor attack on the UnrealIRCD server, which affected Gentoo</a>. That second attack <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/linux-infection-proves-windows-malware-monopoly-is-over-gentoo-ships-backdoor-updated/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">went undetected for six or seven months</a>.)</li>
<li>Once a packager gets a package into the archive, they can provide updates for it <em>in Debian Unstable</em> with no or very little supervision. This is especially true if the packager is a Debian Maintainer (thus able to upload specific packages without needing a sponsor) or a Debian Developer (thus able to upload an update to any package without needing a sponsor). A malicious or compromised DM or DD could thus potentially introduce malicious code into the archive without being noticed. Supplying updates for a package in a stable release is harder and would probably not be so easy to compromise in this way thankfully, but you still are putting your trust in the DMs and DDs of Debian, which could be poorly placed. Remember that Jia Tan was fully trusted and that turned out to be a bad idea.</li>
<li>Many software applications in Debian are outdated, meaning they could carry severe security-related bugs that make them unsafe to use even if they contain no intentionally malicoius code. The Chromium browser package is a good example of this - it was so often out-of-date that the Linux Mint developers <a href="https://blog.linuxmint.com/?p=3978" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">decided to build it themselves for LMDE</a>. Chromium, despite its apparently good security design, is also a massive source of security vulnerabilities probably because it is such a popular application and thus everyone’s looking for vulnerabilities in it. The problems with Chromium might not be as bad now as they were back then, but this kind of thing is still worrying.</li>
<li>There are also packages that Debian just refuses to provide security support for because they’re so hard to support. I can’t remember an example right off the top of my head, but <code>check-support-status</code> can be used to find packages one has installed that fall into this category. I seem to remember something WebKit related warning me about this once.</li>
<li>Users may enable third-party repositories to get software that isn’t available from the Debian archives, or that is outdated in Debian. These repositories are probably OK if the user is installing software from an official upstream source, but there’s nothing stopping someone from making a malicious Debian repo that advertises newer versions of outdated software to make itself attractive. There’s also the incident with a <a href="https://debugpointnews.com/free-download-manager-debian/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">malicious third-party repo for Free Download Manager</a>, which involved a compromise of the authentic Free Download Manager website. (That attack went undetected for <a href="https://www.freedownloadmanager.org/blog/?p=664" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">around two years</a>.)</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these issues could potentially cause serious trouble even for a security-conscious user, and to my awareness no major operating system (Linux or otherwise) makes any attempt to significantly mitigate the risks these kinds of attacks introduce. (Debian’s <code>check-support-status</code> <em>helps</em>, but it only helps with one particular scenario, and it’s not even installed by default on Debian systems as far as I know. Similarly Windows’ and MacOS’s restrictions related to signed code can make it more difficult to run code by people who don’t provide a clear link between their software and their identity, but there’s nothing stopping someone from just publishing signed malicious code, plus identity theft is a thing.) The user is left to figure out what they do or don’t trust by themselves, and while the user should <strong>always</strong> be the final authority on what is or isn’t trusted, it should be recognized that some users are just plain bad at making good decisions about what to trust. As the saying goes, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dancing_pigs" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">“Given a choice between dancing pigs and security, users will pick dancing pigs every time.”</a></p>
<p>How could we harden apt in order to make this problem less of a problem? We <strong>absolutely should not block users from installing software</strong> regardless of what that software is, but it might be a good idea to do something so that the user is given some pause for thought before doing something they probably shouldn’t do. One potential idea might be to wrap <code>apt install</code> commands to see what packages a user is trying to install, determine what sources apt will choose for installing these applications, and then check them against a database of “known good software” and another database of “known bad software”. If the user is trying to install something that isn’t explicitly trusted, they’ll get a warning they can click through, and if they’re trying to install something that is explicitly distrusted, they’ll get a dire warning that requires some effort to bypass. (Or maybe we make all warnings like this require some effort to bypass, although we do have to be careful that we don’t get backlash for “locking down” the OS if we go that route, then again I don’t think users expect us to be trying to mess up our users like Microsoft or Apple might do.) As for how these databases are built, we could add everything that is part of Kicksecure by default to the database, plus a bunch of widely-used software that isn’t suspected to be intrinsically dangerous. Specific third party repos for software like Element, Google Chrome, or Visual Studio Code could also be added. (Yes, I know that Google Chrome is debatable when it comes to whether it’s intrinsically dangerous or not, but you get my point.) We’d probably get some user complaints if we did this sort of thing, but we could always expand the database if people find things that we can determine are widely used, and for those who are using niche applications, they can expand the database themselves. This is just one potential application, I don’t know for sure if this is the best way of doing this, but it might work.</p>

          <title>Virtualbox/KVM for Kicksecure Live</title>

            <p>Virtualbox/KVM for Kicksecure Live</p>
<p>We should consider adding Virtualbox to Kicksecure by default, maybe only for Kicksecure Live USB at least (virtualbox is there before installation, but not after, to reduce attack surface). This will make possible to run any virtual machines from a plausibly-deniable external drive without leaving a trace on the computer. This also helps to reduce attack surface for the host os (kicksecure live usb), as it is amnesic and it is harder for malware to persist, especially with physical write-protection switch enabled.</p>
<p>Kicksecure Live USB → Virtualbox/KVM → Whonix VM/other OS.</p>
<p>Something like this could be done if Kicksecure was installed on the usb drive and the virtualbox installed on it manually, and after that user must be careful to launch live-mode only every time. But this is not as plausibly-deniable as a plain Kicksecure installation media, and it is obvious that Virtualbox was installed there for a reason. If every Kicksecure installation out there contained Virtualbox by default, it would be impossible for an attacker to claim that someone installed virtualisation software for a purpose of hiding something.</p>
<p>Essentially I am talking about something like HiddenVM mod for TAILS but with proper hardened nature of Kicksecure.</p>
<p>If that is not possible, at least we should consider creating a wiki-guide with information on how to add Virtualbox in Kicksecure Live Installation USB manually.</p>

            <p>Woke up one morning with the laptop on my chest. To get Tor rocking I tried to set manually sdwdate clock like I always do, because the CMOS battery is done or something else is off since replacing the battery didint make any difference.</p>
<p>Anyway got <strong>ERROR: Login blocked after 50 attempts</strong>. Followed unlocking instructions from Unlock User Account: Excessive Wrong Password Entry Attempts on Safely Use Root Commands page.</p>
<p>Booted in to a recovery mode in GRUB/BIOS advanced options for … something.<br>
Run the      <strong>faillock --user user --reset</strong>     in the maintenance state/mode.<br>
Went back to regular kicksecure and sudo/login pw was still locked.<br>
Tried several times back and forth with no avail.<br>
Also tried only <strong>faillock</strong> command which should show list of login attempts.<br>
It told me:  <strong>faillock: Error reading tally directory: No such file or directory</strong><br>
Tried  <strong>which faillock</strong>  it told me the path to faillock, so it seems to be existing anyway.</p>
<p>To clarify I can get to desktop by turning on laptop since there is only encryption password prompt, but cant do anything sudo and if I let it idle too long the login prompt comes up and I have to reboot to get back, though I could maybe remove hibernation or whatever it is that triggers login prompt.</p>
<p>Printed all that internets had about it. Havent tried other stuff yet. Many point towards creating/touching such a directory. Dont know if I should follow strangers advice to touch hidden places. What could go wrong?</p>
<p>Still wondering how it got locked. Is it even possible to fall a sleep with hands on keyboard on such a position that the user login prompt gets saturated? Will it accept continous enter as a attempt?</p>

<p>(<strong>KickSecure</strong> / <strong>Whonix</strong>) are both solid choices when it comes to (privacy &amp; security) for a system with low (specs. CPU, RandomAccessMemory &amp; Storage). While <strong>Whonix-Host</strong> is still under heavy development and not available yet to the public, ‘sitting’ with <strong>KS</strong> is the best course of action to be taken.</p>
<p>To experiment, I’ve decided to <em>route specific site to <strong>TheOnionRouter</strong> via PAC’s script on NetworkManager</em> which it doesn’t seems to route correctly. Extensive research had been carried out by me and <em>no (resolution, resources) regarding the issue have been found</em> as of writing.</p>

The Volume Control doesn’t show any output devices besides the dummy output but my laptop’s speakers worked with Windows and the monitor that it’s plugged into via HDMI also has speakers which have been tested working with Qubes OS 4.2 and Fedora Workstation 41.

            <p>Hello everyone,<br>
I’ve come to ask for your help again.<br>
I have been testing the Hunchly application for a few days. I was using their appimage and extension on Brave. At the end of the trial period I decided to delete the application and the extension.<br>
Since then, I’ve been getting a boot error: apparmor.service won’t start.</p>
<p>Here are the log messages regarding the boot error and the inability to start the service manually. The problem is clearly related to the presence of a hunchly profile in apparmor.d. But there’s no mention of this in the documentation.</p>
<p>How can I solve this problem? Thanks in advance for your solution.</p>

            <p>Hi. help me how to change zsh theme? I have .zsh file which I used in previous linux distribution. if this file replaces default .zsh in /home/user/ then only header changes. default zsh is empty (like on github). I am not advanced user and I can not find file which is responsible for commands color scheme. I found that color scheme is connected with desktop-config-dist package, but I do not understand what file is responsible for zsh colors. if I delete desktop-config-dist then other packages are also deleted - I would not like to do that. I will be grateful for help</p>

WARNING: Debian Package Update Check Result: apt-get reports that packages can be updated.<br>
Please update this machine:<br>
(Open a terminal, Start Menu → System → Terminal.)<br>
upgrade-nonroot<br>
Even if system is update. I checked it on my computer and a friend’s computer - always this message. Could you please change it so that this warning appears when there are non-updated packages only?</p>

            <p>Hi, I need to make openvswitch to work on Kicksecure! After I bridge my NIC I can’t connect to internet anymore. I can’t ping anything on the same subnet. I executed <code>arp</code> command and it founds every other machine on the same subnet but the hwaddress(mac address of other machine on the subnet boardcast)  are showing “(incomeplete)”. Please help me!</p>

            <p><strong>Live</strong> <strong>Kicksecure with Live VM</strong></p>
<p>A live Kicksecure host cannot run a VM.</p>
<p>Is it possible to develop a fully <em>stateless</em> system that would function with a live Kicksecure host running a live Whonix VM (set to Immutable in Virtual Box)?</p>
<p>See image of error message here:<br>

– drive. proton. me /urls/   PMZPCBGZA0#j0B4BZFjRiAx</p>
<p>(FYI, KVM seems the more secure virtualization technology to me since I have seen Oracle’s software crash many times on Fedora hosts. But I understand the Company’s expertise can come in handy from time to time.)</p>
<hr>
<p>A few additional security observations:</p>
<p>‘<strong>hardened-kernel</strong>’ is a highly appreciated feature in Kicksecure.<br>
wiki/Hardened-kernel<br>
Other software is far more susceptible to kernel crashes. For example, both Qubes (Fedora Dom0) and Graphene OS have observable soft-spots in their kernel and it would be very unfortunate if one stored a wallet with Amethyst, etc (Android) or in a weak Fedora host. Building Mobian on Pine64 towards a mobile Kicksecure spin would be awesome for secure mobile crypto wallets that could interact with POS IRL<br>

<ul>
<li>virtualization not strong - i.e. rpc and qrexec really all connected<br>
article /  10.1007/s41870-019-00294-x</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Native sandboxing</strong>  like Firejail is also a good place to direct one’s efforts in developing Kicksecure. https:/  /www.  kicksecure. com/wiki/Sandbox-app-launcher<br>
After extensive testing, it would appear that the MAC control and permission hardening paradigm of TAILS is stronger than the compartmentalization and isolation through virtualization strategy of Qubes OS.</p>
<p><strong>Dual Strength Tor Level</strong> options – If one takes a look at Nym (Chaum mixnet - Free Haven whitepapers) VPN, you can see that there is a Wireguard level and a mixnet level for secure messaging and confidential layer blockchain. I would recommend something similar if not handled on an app-by-app basis for levels of tor: <em>one layer with Vanguards</em> and another <em>layer for low-latency</em> tor.</p>
<p><strong>Kloak</strong> - keystroke anonymization is also a very interesting Kicksecure feature under development that is not offered in any other major distribution.</p>

            <p>Timely system updates are very important for security. It is very convenient to have notifications about new updates on desktop/panel. This is perfectly implemented in mint, mx and other distros. Many users do not check updates - one of my friends installed Kicksecure and has not updated system for a long time. He thought that there were no new updates. Such tool in new versions of Kicksecure would add convenience and security to users.<br>

            <p>Sdwdate wont connect. I cant update and upgrade Kicksecure either.<br>
Tor browser works fine though.<br>
Sdwdate started doing this recently.<br>
Yesterday sdwdate just finally worked for some reason.<br>
Today I have restarted it every 5-10 minutes for the last 2 hours in hope of resurrecting it.</p>
<p>Update/upgrade command times out while waiting response from proxys.<br>
Synaptic Package Manager wont connect either.<br>
also System Check program cant connect to Tor for Tor Bootstrap test.</p>
<p>So why browser connects, but rest of the toys wont?</p>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>How do you use Kicksecure yourself? Do you think Kicksecure is the most secure host OS (or the most secure Debian OS?) or do you use it in a VM, with host Fedora, NixOS, Alpine, openSuse, Qubes…? The developers’ experience is very important and interesting. After all, you’ve studied many Linux distributions and are creating Kicksecure based on the experience of using other systems. I’m interested in your opinion at the end of 2024. And what do you think about using Nix manager in Kicksecure? What do you think about using distrobox with podman to install packages in Alpine, Fedora or other secure distros?</p>
