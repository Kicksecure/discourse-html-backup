            <p>How do I install a minimal Kicksecure environment? I don’t need Tor, fonts or xserver but <code>kicksecure-cli</code> force me to install a lot of unnecessary packages. Is there anyway that allows me to install a minimal Kicksecure environment? I also don’t need swap at all, why it creates a swap partition for me?<br>
I think we need a <code>kicksecure-minimum</code> metapackage without Tor, fonts or any thing like <code>p7zip</code> or <code>libgtk</code>.</p>

            <p>Bookworm-based kicksecure-qubes-cli in Qubes 4.2:<br>
Seemingly after applying the massive Kicksecure refresh on December 18, previously-working OpenVPN says it can’t connect to the VPN servers.<br>
OpenVPN is used from network-manager, but the “Can’t connect”  messages are also seen if running openvpn directly in terminal.</p>
<p>Deleting and re-configuring the VPN connection didn’t help.<br>
The firewall rules look the same as before.<br>
Spent time troubleshooting and ended up rebuilding the template. Found out that this VPN setup works OK if the Kicksecure updates are not applied.<br>
It also works OK on older, bullseye-based Kicksecure, which didn’t get the recent hardening updates.</p>
<p>Did something just change with the hardening of services, firewall, config files, apparmor, etc.?<br>
I’d like to eventually resume getting the kicksecure updates. Any advice?</p>

            <p>Hello Kicksecure team,</p>
<p>I noticed that live-mode in a VM virtualbox is not functionning as intented from my personnal setup. I’m using Ubuntu as Host and Kicksecure is installed in a VM (2 cases: VM import from Kicksecure + Debian cli minimal install with Kicksecure installed manually on it).</p>
<p>*Here is the issue (for both cases)<br>
1/ Boot in live mode<br>
2/ Create a folder + texte file in /home/user and save it.<br>
3/ Shutdown the VM<br>
4/ Reboot in live mode<br>
5/ The folder &amp; files are still there.</p>
<p>*Some other infos:<br>
1/ I did this multiple times with the same result<br>
2/ I also completely shutdown my ubuntu host.<br>
3/ Synaptic and ClamAV packages installed.</p>
<p>*Is it then an issue from me or are you able to replicate this?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>The Kicksecure Template for Qubes OS<br>
still requires funding and development.<br>
https ://www . kicksecure . com/wiki/Qubes</p>
<p>There seems to be no way to update from sources without special consideration paid to onionized sourcing when certain unattributed network obstacles persist.<br>
https ://forums . debian . net/ viewtopic.php?p=770508&amp;hilit=Tor+http#p770508</p>
<p>Why does this happen? No one has explained.</p>
<p>Does anyone on this forum know why this is the case? Certainly, Debian does not targeted universal ban a computer user on any platform with roaming total coverage as a community. So the obstacle must be technical in nature.</p>
<p>I am simply trying to get a VPN qube functional but all the Debian updates are blocked and the Fedora modifications are no doubt elaborate.</p>

            <p>I’m going to install Kicksecure on a bare-metal Debian host.<br>
This will be a clean install from scratch of Debian 12 &gt; Kicksecure &gt; Whonix<br>
Kicksecure will only be used as host for Whonix (will not be the main driver for everyday life)</p>
<p>So I have a choice:</p>
<ol>
<li>Install Debian XFCE + <code>kicksecure-cli-host</code></li>
<li>Install Debian CLI (without DE) + <code>kicksecure-xfce-host</code></li>
<li>Install Debian XFCE + <code>kicksecure-xfce-host</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Can anyone answer if there are any significant differences in these scenarios?</p>
<p>I’m asking because it says <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Debian#Install_the_Kicksecure_Package" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">here</a> about CLI version: “This package provides better kernel hardening, improved entropy, and other security features”</p>
<p>Does this mean that version of scenario 1 above (Debian XFCE + <code>kicksecure-cli-host</code>) is the most secure?<br>
Is <code>kicksecure-cli-host</code> more secure than <code>kicksecure-xfce-host</code>?</p>

          <title>(Qubes OS) In-place upgrade from 16 to 17 changed VM monitor behavior</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[ianbush]]></dc:creator>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I upgraded some of my Kicksecure based TemplateVM from 16 to 17 using the release-upgrade way. After it was upgraded and restarted, I noticed that both my monitor were merged together instead of being separated. Here’s an example:</p>
<p>Kicksecure-16 Template xrandr:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">Screen 0: minimum 64 x 64, current 3840 x 1080, maximum 32767 x 32767
DUMMY0 connected primary 1920x1080+1920+0 0mm x 0mm
   QB3840x1080   46.13 +
   QB1920x1080   59.96* 
DUMMY1 connected 1920x1080+0+0 0mm x 0mm
   QB3840x1080   46.13 +
   QB1920x1080   59.96* 
</code></pre>
<p>Kicksecure-17 Template xrandr:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">Screen 0: minimum 64 x 64, current 3840 x 1080, maximum 32767 x 32767
DUMMY0 connected primary 3840x1080+0+0 0mm x 0mm
   QB3840x1080   46.13*+
DUMMY1 disconnected
</code></pre>
<p>For some reason, morphing a debian-12 Template to Kicksecure-17 can’t replicate the issue, only upgrading from Kicksecure 16 to 17 (Debian 11 to 12) can do it.<br>
I checked all x11 dependencies between the templates and installed a few missing packages but I’m not able to fix this. What else can be done in this case?</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

            <p>hello all,</p>
<p>A bit of a tech dumbass as the name indicates, so apologies for not knowing basics. Am a journo trying to learn more a secure OS.</p>
<p>Installing KS Debian XFCE took about a week trying all sorts of suggestions and still not got both modules running properly. But for now my latest update attempts appear to have borked my installation.</p>
<p>Was running Debian 11 bullseye<br>
did a sudo apt update + upgrade<br>
came back to desktop to find mouse frozen.<br>
rebooted, twice, thrice and mouse worked for awhile.<br>
at one stage, not even the Kicksecure home page loaded properly i.e. links not clickable.</p>
<p>Now showing Debian 12 but functionality comes and goes.<br>
For example, Synaptic is no longer loadable from menu, only terminal. Sometimes it disappears between alt-tab programme switching.<br>
No matter what terminal commands I try, however, terminal output always ends with same eight (now nine) errors:</p>
<p>Errors were encountered while processing:<br>
linux-headers-6.1.0-11-amd64<br>
linux-image-6.1.0-11-amd64<br>
linux-headers-amd64<br>
linux-image-amd64<br>
tirdad-dkms<br>
tirdad<br>
kicksecure-cli-host-packages-recommended<br>
kicksecure-cli-host<br>
kicksecure-xfce-host</p>
<p><a href="https://anonpaste.pw/v/36413d02-8ce9-44ed-b0a4-642bb6e66d73#lH0GpNXT3knVypo1eMdWowzuiSK464WISMH7umZDBPE" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Full terminal output</a></p>
<p>Have spent days on trying to solve this and searched literally dozens of help pages, forums, and note that there is not one result for [kicksecure] on the <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/search?q=%5Bkicksecure%5D+file+not+found" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">recommended</a> stack exchange page, so am trying here as it seems more active.</p>
<p>Trying not to take valuable time and have read <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Forum_Best_Practices#Posting_Links_for_New_Users" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Posting links for new users</a></p>
<p>Some of the other things I’ve seen over the last few days:</p>
<p><strong>General notes on experience</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Right click not working on desktop or anywhere else, including programmes eg Librewrite.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ctrl-v not working.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Host OS Kicksecure start button not responding to clicks, can still access programmes via alt-f3</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>VB opens but VM whonix gateway not working: No response to clicks on VM start, settings, or VB screen maximisation/minimasation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can open but not close functions in LibreWrite, eg can open and run spell check but spell check does not respond to x (top-right) box click, not able to tab to (bottom right) x close box. Have to restart LibreWrite to close Spellcheck.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Librewrite select-all works via ctrl+A, but clicking on the selected text box does not enable editing, only pressing the keyboard down arrow releases the selection for editing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cannot click already-open programmes via top toolbar tabs, can only switch between open programmes via alt+tab on keyboard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>About XFCE tab opens, but close button does not work. Red upper-right close x does work.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Tried removing and reinstalling VirtualBox but still same problems.</p>
<p>Overall, like others moving to Debian 12, the system now seems to have settled down from the above experiences. But am unable to remove programmes I’ve installed via Synaptic eg Signal, due to above errors.</p>
<p>Sorry for long post, and any advice grovelling welcome.</p>
<p>NOT A NINJA</p>

            <p>Hi!<br>
I’m working on a project where I must use the Python package metadata-parser, which for some reason has no debian counterpart for direct HTML scraping of the internet.  Anyway when I used Kicksecure on Debian 11 I was able to use PIP to grab the python package.  Now that I’m on Debian 12 I’m getting some solid error messages.  So this support request is to be shown the correct approach of respecting KickSecures security measures.  Should I use the virtual environment for Python as they recommend.<br>
Error Message on trying to use PIP:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[user ~/]% su -c ‘pip install metadata-parser’ (also tried sudo and nosudo)<br>
Password:<br>
error: externally-managed-environment</p>
<p>× This environment is externally managed<br>
╰─&gt; To install Python packages system-wide, try apt install<br>
python3-xyz, where xyz is the package you are trying to<br>
install.</p>
<pre><code>If you wish to install a non-Debian-packaged Python package,
create a virtual environment using python3 -m venv path/to/venv.
Then use path/to/venv/bin/python and path/to/venv/bin/pip. Make
sure you have python3-full installed.

If you wish to install a non-Debian packaged Python application,
it may be easiest to use pipx install xyz, which will manage a
virtual environment for you. Make sure you have pipx installed.

See /usr/share/doc/python3.11/README.venv for more information.
</code></pre>
<p>note: If you believe this is a mistake, please contact your Python installation or OS distribution provider. You can override this, at the risk of breaking your Python installation or OS, by passing --break-system-packages.<br>
hint: See PEP 668 for the detailed specification.<br>
zsh: exit 1     su -c ‘pip install metadata-parser’</p>

            <p>Is there a built-in way to enable a Transparent Tor proxy on kicksecure? I’m investigating how appropriate it is for hosting onion sites on a VPS.</p>
<p>What do you think of the solution of enabling corridor on kicksecure?</p>

            <p>I just wanted to clarify that the torified Apt traffic on Kicksecure is only Apt traffic. In that case, if a user wanted to use a VPN client on there desktop would there be any correlation risks?</p>
<p>Or would it be perfectly okay to use a VPN with the torified apt traffic. I guess my concern is that if I’m using a paid VPN with my identity and torified Apt traffic, I don’t want that to be correlated.</p>
<p>Have I understood this correctly?</p>
