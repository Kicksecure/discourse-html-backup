    <title>I am stuck in grub rescue after using Kicksecure on USB</title>

    <description>Host is also Kicksecure. I used and then stopped using a usb to run Kicksecure persistently and now I am stuck in grub rescue because my desktop is searching for the usb instead of loading into the desktop ssd. I tried booting to the correct ssd in bios, but it still took me to grub rescue after and I was having a hard time getting it to choose the right boot device.</description>
