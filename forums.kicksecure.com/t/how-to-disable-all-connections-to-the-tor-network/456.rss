    <title>How to disable all connections to the tor network?</title>
    <link>https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/how-to-disable-all-connections-to-the-tor-network/456</link>
    <description>Hello,

I am trying to disable those connections by disabling sdwdate but I am still sending and receiving traffic from the tor network, do you know what else I should do?


Any Help would be appreciated.</description>
