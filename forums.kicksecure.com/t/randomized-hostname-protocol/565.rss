    <description># Recommendations

Obviously a generic hostname is advisable, but in practice, there are limited other solutions available at present. One is to turn off any protocols that are not strictly necessary and which leak hostnames, particularly when insecure places are visited. This reduces the attack surface, but is impractical for certain protocols; for example, DHCP is necessary for Internet connectivity and many services depend on protocols such as mDNS. Another option is to use different hostnames for different purposes, rather than relying on a global hostname - this option is available on some OSes. Ultimately, **a randomized hostname protocol is necessary** to protect privacy, similar to methods utilized for MAC addresses. 

What is a randomized hostname protocol? 
Do kicksecure randomize it?
