    <title>ISO - no default for encryption on/off - user should choose explicitly</title>

    <description>The user should either:

* select encryption
* not select encryption

But there should be no default choice. The user should make an explicit choice.

This is because unfortunately on Freedom Software Linux desktop distributions, there is no easy way to enable full disk encryption after installation.</description>

            <p>There are a few ways one could implement this, some of them more invasive than others. One way that might work is to simply prevent the user from proceeding past the partitioning screen if encryption is enabled but a passphrase isn’t set, and then have the disk encryption checkbox <em>checked by default</em>. In that instance a user would be required to either choose a passphrase or disable encryption. IMO this is the best solution since it should be reasonably obvious to the user <em>why</em> they can’t proceed, and it forces them to make a conscious choice, which is the goal.</p>
<p>It’s also possible to make the “Encrypt system” checkbox tristate, but that comes with some disadvantages and probably won’t have good UX (it might not be clear to the user <em>why</em> they can’t proceed, especially since users oftentimes don’t even notice that the disk encryption checkbox is there at all).</p>
