    <title>Printer Troubles</title>

    <description>Hello.

I am having troubles connecting to my Brother HL-L2350DW WiFi printer (no USB; it&#39;s a laptop).  I just installed Kicksecure, so I am trying to figure out *why* my LibreOffice documents won&#39;t print.  I installed the `system-config-printer` app to connect to my printer.  I asked the Debian community in another forum what packages I&#39;m missing.  They told me to install some packages from the Debian repos (which they kindly provided), and I obliged.  My printer *does show up* in the Printer Config app under the Network section when you try to add a printer.

But I cannot connect to it.  Everytime I think I have made a successful connection to my Brother printer, I cannot print a test page.  So I delete the entry and start over again!

I either get 2 things:  The previously mentioned &quot;successful connection&quot;, OR this error message POP-UP `CUPS server error. There was an error during the CUPS operation: &#39;server-error-internal-error&#39;.`

I have tried disabling CUPS&#39;s AppArmor profiles into complain mode, but still no avail!

I have even tried this solution with Brother&#39;s official &quot;.deb&quot; printer package:

httpswwwlinuxquestionsorgquestions/linux-hardware-18/installation-of-brother-printer-drivers-and-device-uri-number-4175698450

I ultimately believe I am fundamentally encountering a skill issue:  I do not adequately know how to troubleshoot printer problems on Linux.  I don&#39;t know where to look on my system!  Is it `/var/logs`??  Do I look there?  I know my printer **DOES WORK** because I have successfully printed a CUPS Test Page from Linux Mint.  I just did that 4 weeks ago!

Please help me.  Debian *or* Kicksecure is kicking my ass.</description>
