    <description>hi. my girlfriend installed morphing kicksecure on debian xfce and her pure-vpn stopped working - can&#39;t connect to server. it looks like these are problems due to dns changes. how to return default dns settings or what package to delete so that kicksecure doesn&#39;t interfere with dns? i tried to delete several packages, but to no avail. only timeshift solves problem - a return to default debian. i use nordvpn and mullvad - there is no such problem.</description>

<p>Not sure if thats the issue but if it is then its unsolvable by default. we try to avoid systemd as much as possible and this looks like app specific change so you need to figure out how to set apps needs on the OS.</p>

            <p>All apps work - telegram, whatsapp, signal, browser (except tor without tor). As soon as you uninstall kicksecure and pure vpn instantly connects to servers. That’s why I am asking which kicksecure package can affect internet? You can install tor in kicksecure, then disable tor network: network.dns.disabled ⇒ false extensions.torlauncher.start_tor ⇒ false network.proxy.socks ⇒ _ and this browser won’t work, but it work in default debian-ubuntu. If you can launch this browser, it will launch a pure vpn. I knew for sure that security-misk, tirdad, sdwdate packages were definitely not related to this problem</p>

<p>I should have been more clear - I’m trying to find out if DNS is working for other apps or not. It sounds like it probably is, but just so we can be completely sure, can you share the output of <code>dig kicksecure.com</code>?</p>
<p>Finally, other users of PureVPN have noticed “connection timed out” errors that didn’t have anything to do with DNS. See <a href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=230486" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">[SOLVED] PureVPN with OpenVPN timeout / Networking, Server, and Protection / Arch Linux Forums</a>, maybe that has some info that would be useful?</p>

yes without vpn everything works except tor browser without tor network - my girlfriend has 2 tor browsers, one is like a mallvad. in this browser there is no internet - “check dns settings” (internet works without kicksecure)<br>
Package: systemd-resolved<br>
Status: install ok installed<br>
pure-vpn log says that connection timed out</p>
<p>you should know which package in kicksecure is responsible for internet or dns management. i thought it was kicksecure-network-conf package but no - it’s not even installed</p>

            <p>To begin with, I’d recommend running <code>sudo apt install --no-install-recommends kicksecure-cli-host</code> to put back at least most of the packages you’ve tried removing. Without knowing what you removed, it’s hard to know whether you’ve potentially weakened the system’s security or not.</p>
<p>Next, the DNS stuff. Right now I’m not totally sure that DNS is actually the problem, and if it is, it’s unclear what’s wrong with it, so I need to ask you for some more information.</p>
<ul>
<li>Can you share the contents of your <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> file? This file indicates what DNS server the system is using. I <em>do</em> need to see the IP addresses in this file, since they tell me what DNS servers the system is configured to use. Unless your network is very badly misconfigured, or you’re hosting your own public DNS server in your house, those IP addresses won’t be usable to locate or identify you, and thus should be safe to share publicly. You can look up any IP addresses you see to make extra sure.</li>
<li>Is the computer able to connect to websites without a VPN?</li>
<li>What is the output of <code>dpkg-query -s systemd-resolved</code>?</li>
<li>Does “pure-vpn” have logs you can share that could help us understand what’s wrong a little bit better?</li>
</ul>
<p>I have an idea for a fix, but let’s start with that and see where things go from there.</p>

            <p>hi. my girlfriend installed morphing kicksecure on debian xfce and her pure-vpn stopped working - can’t connect to server. it looks like these are problems due to dns changes. how to return default dns settings or what package to delete so that kicksecure doesn’t interfere with dns? i tried to delete several packages, but to no avail. only timeshift solves problem - a return to default debian. i use nordvpn and mullvad - there is no such problem.</p>
