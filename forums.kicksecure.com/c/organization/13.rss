          <title>GrapheneOS Attacks Kicksecure! What should the response be?</title>

            <p>I do not know what the correct forum category is to post this. I presume that this category is okay? Please move the topic if there is a better forum category for it.</p>
<p><a href="https://xcancel.com/GrapheneOS/status/1861465637886754839#m" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://xcancel.com/GrapheneOS/status/1861465637886754839#m</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Kicksecure is awful. Has a horrible choice of base OS for security and they don’t do valuable work to improve it. They sabotaged security efforts and are spreading misinformation about allocator hardening and other topics they don’t understand.</p>
<p>Secureblue is doing useful work.</p>
<p>The concept used by Whonix for forcing traffic through Tor makes sense but the OS has awful security, just like the Tor Browser itself having awful security. Someone making an equivalent out of Fedora Silverblue or Arch would obsolete it.</p>
<p>Kicksecure/Whonix doesn’t do any significant hardening and the efforts to do that were stalled and then rolled back when the person responsible for most of it left the project. It has some minor anonymity changes easily done elsewhere. Encrypted swap is widely used elsewhere.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Presumably, you all disagree with Daniel Micay / GrapheneOS. What is the rebuttal here?</p>
<p>Thank you for your responses.</p>

            <p>Hi Patrick,</p>
<p>I see Aaron Rainbolt is only active since end 2022. Who is this guy? How can have so much knowledge while only being publicly active for 2 years? A Kicksecure coder has a lot of responsibilities.</p>
<p>Please triple check all his code and be sure it’s not a bad actor like with xz</p>

          <title>Create a video of installation from ISO</title>

            <p>Morphing Debian to Kicksecure is easy. VIrtualBox is easy. KVM is hard. ISO is even harder because requires interacting with real hardware (not considering that ISO can be imported to VirtualBox).</p>
<p>Please create a video detailing all the steps from downloading an ISO, flashing the image to a device, booting the live ISO and running Calamares and finally rebooting and booting to the installed system.</p>
<p>Tails has an animation:</p>
<p><a href="https://tails.net/install/inc/videos/boot-menu-key.webm" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://tails.net/install/inc/videos/boot-menu-key.webm</a></p>
<p>Found on page <a href="https://tails.net/install/linux/index.en.html" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Linux install</a>, step 5/7. Their video only shows the hardest part, entering the boot menu and choosing the device to boot from. A video for Kicksecure could also be only this section, undoubtedly the hardest part, or wait till some youtuber do a 20 minute review video, being 15 minutes of installation and 5 minutes of opening the browser and the terminal and reading the FAQ out loud.</p>
<p>Animations or filming real hardware would do just fine, both have pros and cons. The animation gives more privacy to the maker of the video, but recording real hardware is much more relatable to the user that is seeing another person doing the same thing they are going to do.</p>
<p>Please take a look at <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/ISO" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Kicksecure Operating System Live ISO, Kicksecure-Host Installer</a> to understand what are the steps to install Kicksecure from ISO. If you don’t understand the steps, please let me know, I wrote that page.</p>

  <p>This proposal outlines a strategy for increasing review bandwidth and development efficiency within Linux derivative projects by granting base distribution developers review and merge rights for derivative distributions.</p>
