            <p>Hello Kicksecure team,</p>
<p>I noticed that live-mode in a VM virtualbox is not functionning as intented from my personnal setup. I’m using Ubuntu as Host and Kicksecure is installed in a VM (2 cases: VM import from Kicksecure + Debian cli minimal install with Kicksecure installed manually on it).</p>
<p>*Here is the issue (for both cases)<br>
1/ Boot in live mode<br>
2/ Create a folder + texte file in /home/user and save it.<br>
3/ Shutdown the VM<br>
4/ Reboot in live mode<br>
5/ The folder &amp; files are still there.</p>
<p>*Some other infos:<br>
1/ I did this multiple times with the same result<br>
2/ I also completely shutdown my ubuntu host.<br>
3/ Synaptic and ClamAV packages installed.</p>
<p>*Is it then an issue from me or are you able to replicate this?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>The Kicksecure Template for Qubes OS<br>
still requires funding and development.<br>
https ://www . kicksecure . com/wiki/Qubes</p>
<p>There seems to be no way to update from sources without special consideration paid to onionized sourcing when certain unattributed network obstacles persist.<br>
https ://forums . debian . net/ viewtopic.php?p=770508&amp;hilit=Tor+http#p770508</p>
<p>Why does this happen? No one has explained.</p>
<p>Does anyone on this forum know why this is the case? Certainly, Debian does not targeted universal ban a computer user on any platform with roaming total coverage as a community. So the obstacle must be technical in nature.</p>
<p>I am simply trying to get a VPN qube functional but all the Debian updates are blocked and the Fedora modifications are no doubt elaborate.</p>

          <title>Confusing information about installing `kicksecure-cli-host` or `kicksecure-xfce-host`</title>

            <p>I’m going to install Kicksecure on a bare-metal Debian host.<br>
This will be a clean install from scratch of Debian 12 &gt; Kicksecure &gt; Whonix<br>
Kicksecure will only be used as host for Whonix (will not be the main driver for everyday life)</p>
<p>So I have a choice:</p>
<ol>
<li>Install Debian XFCE + <code>kicksecure-cli-host</code></li>
<li>Install Debian CLI (without DE) + <code>kicksecure-xfce-host</code></li>
<li>Install Debian XFCE + <code>kicksecure-xfce-host</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Can anyone answer if there are any significant differences in these scenarios?</p>
<p>I’m asking because it says <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Debian#Install_the_Kicksecure_Package" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">here</a> about CLI version: “This package provides better kernel hardening, improved entropy, and other security features”</p>
<p>Does this mean that version of scenario 1 above (Debian XFCE + <code>kicksecure-cli-host</code>) is the most secure?<br>
Is <code>kicksecure-cli-host</code> more secure than <code>kicksecure-xfce-host</code>?</p>

          <title>(Qubes OS) In-place upgrade from 16 to 17 changed VM monitor behavior</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[ianbush]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Support</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I upgraded some of my Kicksecure based TemplateVM from 16 to 17 using the release-upgrade way. After it was upgraded and restarted, I noticed that both my monitor were merged together instead of being separated. Here’s an example:</p>
<p>Kicksecure-16 Template xrandr:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">Screen 0: minimum 64 x 64, current 3840 x 1080, maximum 32767 x 32767
DUMMY0 connected primary 1920x1080+1920+0 0mm x 0mm
   QB3840x1080   46.13 +
   QB1920x1080   59.96* 
DUMMY1 connected 1920x1080+0+0 0mm x 0mm
   QB3840x1080   46.13 +
   QB1920x1080   59.96* 
</code></pre>
<p>Kicksecure-17 Template xrandr:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">Screen 0: minimum 64 x 64, current 3840 x 1080, maximum 32767 x 32767
DUMMY0 connected primary 3840x1080+0+0 0mm x 0mm
   QB3840x1080   46.13*+
DUMMY1 disconnected
</code></pre>
<p>For some reason, morphing a debian-12 Template to Kicksecure-17 can’t replicate the issue, only upgrading from Kicksecure 16 to 17 (Debian 11 to 12) can do it.<br>
I checked all x11 dependencies between the templates and installed a few missing packages but I’m not able to fix this. What else can be done in this case?</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>hello all,</p>
<p>A bit of a tech dumbass as the name indicates, so apologies for not knowing basics. Am a journo trying to learn more a secure OS.</p>
<p>Installing KS Debian XFCE took about a week trying all sorts of suggestions and still not got both modules running properly. But for now my latest update attempts appear to have borked my installation.</p>
<p>Was running Debian 11 bullseye<br>
did a sudo apt update + upgrade<br>
came back to desktop to find mouse frozen.<br>
rebooted, twice, thrice and mouse worked for awhile.<br>
at one stage, not even the Kicksecure home page loaded properly i.e. links not clickable.</p>
<p>Now showing Debian 12 but functionality comes and goes.<br>
For example, Synaptic is no longer loadable from menu, only terminal. Sometimes it disappears between alt-tab programme switching.<br>
No matter what terminal commands I try, however, terminal output always ends with same eight (now nine) errors:</p>
<p>Errors were encountered while processing:<br>
linux-headers-6.1.0-11-amd64<br>
linux-image-6.1.0-11-amd64<br>
linux-headers-amd64<br>
linux-image-amd64<br>
tirdad-dkms<br>
tirdad<br>
kicksecure-cli-host-packages-recommended<br>
kicksecure-cli-host<br>
kicksecure-xfce-host</p>
<p><a href="https://anonpaste.pw/v/36413d02-8ce9-44ed-b0a4-642bb6e66d73#lH0GpNXT3knVypo1eMdWowzuiSK464WISMH7umZDBPE" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Full terminal output</a></p>
<p>Have spent days on trying to solve this and searched literally dozens of help pages, forums, and note that there is not one result for [kicksecure] on the <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/search?q=%5Bkicksecure%5D+file+not+found" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">recommended</a> stack exchange page, so am trying here as it seems more active.</p>
<p>Trying not to take valuable time and have read <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Forum_Best_Practices#Posting_Links_for_New_Users" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Posting links for new users</a></p>
<p>Some of the other things I’ve seen over the last few days:</p>
<p><strong>General notes on experience</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Right click not working on desktop or anywhere else, including programmes eg Librewrite.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ctrl-v not working.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Host OS Kicksecure start button not responding to clicks, can still access programmes via alt-f3</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>VB opens but VM whonix gateway not working: No response to clicks on VM start, settings, or VB screen maximisation/minimasation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can open but not close functions in LibreWrite, eg can open and run spell check but spell check does not respond to x (top-right) box click, not able to tab to (bottom right) x close box. Have to restart LibreWrite to close Spellcheck.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Librewrite select-all works via ctrl+A, but clicking on the selected text box does not enable editing, only pressing the keyboard down arrow releases the selection for editing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cannot click already-open programmes via top toolbar tabs, can only switch between open programmes via alt+tab on keyboard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>About XFCE tab opens, but close button does not work. Red upper-right close x does work.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Tried removing and reinstalling VirtualBox but still same problems.</p>
<p>Overall, like others moving to Debian 12, the system now seems to have settled down from the above experiences. But am unable to remove programmes I’ve installed via Synaptic eg Signal, due to above errors.</p>
<p>Sorry for long post, and any advice grovelling welcome.</p>
<p>NOT A NINJA</p>

          <title>Using Python3 with KickSecure</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[mh4speech]]></dc:creator>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hi!<br>
I’m working on a project where I must use the Python package metadata-parser, which for some reason has no debian counterpart for direct HTML scraping of the internet.  Anyway when I used Kicksecure on Debian 11 I was able to use PIP to grab the python package.  Now that I’m on Debian 12 I’m getting some solid error messages.  So this support request is to be shown the correct approach of respecting KickSecures security measures.  Should I use the virtual environment for Python as they recommend.<br>
Error Message on trying to use PIP:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[user ~/]% su -c ‘pip install metadata-parser’ (also tried sudo and nosudo)<br>
Password:<br>
error: externally-managed-environment</p>
<p>× This environment is externally managed<br>
╰─&gt; To install Python packages system-wide, try apt install<br>
python3-xyz, where xyz is the package you are trying to<br>
install.</p>
<pre><code>If you wish to install a non-Debian-packaged Python package,
create a virtual environment using python3 -m venv path/to/venv.
Then use path/to/venv/bin/python and path/to/venv/bin/pip. Make
sure you have python3-full installed.

If you wish to install a non-Debian packaged Python application,
it may be easiest to use pipx install xyz, which will manage a
virtual environment for you. Make sure you have pipx installed.

See /usr/share/doc/python3.11/README.venv for more information.
</code></pre>
<p>note: If you believe this is a mistake, please contact your Python installation or OS distribution provider. You can override this, at the risk of breaking your Python installation or OS, by passing --break-system-packages.<br>
hint: See PEP 668 for the detailed specification.<br>
zsh: exit 1     su -c ‘pip install metadata-parser’</p>

            <p>I just wanted to clarify that the torified Apt traffic on Kicksecure is only Apt traffic. In that case, if a user wanted to use a VPN client on there desktop would there be any correlation risks?</p>
<p>Or would it be perfectly okay to use a VPN with the torified apt traffic. I guess my concern is that if I’m using a paid VPN with my identity and torified Apt traffic, I don’t want that to be correlated.</p>
<p>Have I understood this correctly?</p>

            <p>Please excuse the throwaway account. I just want to anonymously report this issue:<br>
After upgrading Whonix (/Kicksecure) from bullseye to bookworm with the release-upgrade script provided, the livecheck.sh script will allways detect that there is something mounted in read-write (and therefore show this in the systray). This is due to the weird fact, that since bookworm, lsblk -all shows empty loop devices from 0-7 that are all read-write and hence trigger livecheck.sh to believe the system is mounted in read-write.<br>
I was not able to understand why these loop devices are present in bookworm.</p>
<p>This all occurs with the system correctly being mounted in read-only and started with grub-live, therefore confusing users.</p>

            <p>Hello.</p>
<p>My laptop is just an old toaster; it is a very low powered machine.  I currently cannot handle the security features of having SMT turned off.  I understand turning it back on poses a greater security risk, but at this point I’d rather have a functional laptop.</p>
<p>How do I turn SMT back on?  Please save my old toaster!  My Old Trusty really needs that hyperthreading again.  Intel Core i5 (3rd generation) dual core + hyperthreading.</p>
<p>I think you guys have done wonders as far as security is concerned for the Linux desktop, and I pray for your continued success.</p>
<p>I wish adding your Kicksecure repo to an immutable distro like Vanilla OS was a simple and easy process.  Having atomic updates with Kicksecure’s security layering would be my absolute dreamboat Linux distro!</p>

          <title>Hardware detection problems: CD-ROM (special device /dev/sr0 does not exist) and HP LaserJet 4 printer (hplip does not detect)</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[ratatat]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Support</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Computer:	Lenovo Thinkpad T500<br>
OS:		Kicksecure (distromorph)(latest version)<br>
DE:		Xfce<br>
Printer:	HP LaserJet 4<br>
CD Drive:	Thinkpad Ultrabay</p>
<p>I have a laptop on which I recently re-installed the Kicksecure. It is a distromorph from a fresh re-installation of the latest version of Debian.<br>
I have never been able to get the DVD/CD-RW drive to work. When I insert a CD or DVD, I hear the drive whirring, but nothing pops up on the desktop.  If I type ‘sudo thunar’ into the terminal, I am able to see the drive in the sidebar, but if I try to mount it, it tells me the following:</p>
<p>Failed to mount “cdrom0”.<br>
mount: /media/cdrom0: special device /dev/sr0 does not exist.</p>
<p>Before morphing this installation, I tested a CD to make sure the drive was functional. On Debian, the CD popped up on the desktop and I was about to mount the drive. It seems to be the morph into Kicksecure which causes the problem. As a security-focused distro, I assume it is intentional.</p>
<p>A similar problem occurs with my printer. It is an HP LaserJet 4, a printer known for its GNU/Linux-friendliness. As it uses a parallel port, I used a parallel-to-USB adapter I had lying around the house. I read somewhere that some units use blobs, so I also bought a parallel-to USB adapter from ThinkPenguin which does not use proprietary firmware blobs, so I don’t believe it contributes to the problem. I installed hp-lip and attemtped to set-up the printer, but the discovery tool doesn’t detect it. Here is what I have done so far:</p>
<p>-I tested both adapters. Nothing.<br>
-I checked dmesg to see if the printer appears. I don’t see anything in particular which looks like something has been plugged in. Could it be because it’s a parallel-to-USB connection instead of a regular USB device? I have no other parallel devices to test.<br>
-I restarted the computer with the printer plugged in and turned on and checked dmesg again as well as running hp-setup. Still nothing.</p>
<p>I was unable to test the printer on Debian before the morph, but I wanted to know if anyone has had a similar problem. Post-morph, other USB devices such as external HDDs, USB drives, and a webcam work with no issue. The only other USB device which has trouble with recognition…is an external CD drive. I assume the permissions for external and internal CD drives are the same, so it traces its roots to the first problem.</p>
<p>Before posting, I had a look through the docs under the following pages which I thought might give me clues:</p>
<p>-Printing and Scanning (page returned blank)<br>
-System Configuration and Access<br>
-Advanced Host Security<br>
-Operating System Hardening<br>
-Protection Against Physical Attacks<br>
-Troubleshooting<br>
-Full Disk Encryption<br>
-Malware, Computer Viruses, Firmware Trojans and Antivirus Scanners</p>
<p>I tried these search terms:</p>
<p>failed to mount cdrom0 mount: /media/cdrom0: special device /dev/sr0 does not exist error debian<br>
failed to mount cdrom0 mount: /media/cdrom0: special device /dev/sr0 does not exist error kicksecure<br>
cdrom0 error kicksecure<br>
cdrom0 error debian<br>
sr0 does not exist kicksecure<br>
sr0 does not exist debian</p>
<p>hplip debian laserjet 4<br>
hplip kicksecure laserjet 4<br>
hp-setup kicksecure<br>
hp-setup debian<br>
hp laserjet 4 no recognition dmesg<br>
hp laserjet 4 no discovery hplip usb</p>
<p>For the CD-ROM:<br>
After killing the CSS on this page, I followed the instructions verbatim. I still returned the original error in bash after completing them. Perhaps it’s because RHEL differs in its notation than Debian? If so, how do I modify it?<br>
https :// www . ibm . com/support/pages/linux-error-mount-special-device-devcdrom-does-not-exist-cd-rom-drive-ibm-eserver-bladecenter</p>
<p>This page did not load for me. I suspect Cloudflare usage, as I’m on Tor Browser with Javascript disabled.<br>
https :// www . linuxquestions . org /questions/linux-hardware-18/mount-special-device-dev-cdrom-does-not-exist-21369/</p>
<p>Same error as before:<br>
https :// linuxconfig . org /how-to-mount-cdrom-in-linux</p>
<p>For the Printer:<br>
https :// packages.debian .org/ bullseye/hplip<br>
https :// www.openprinting .org/ printer/HP/HP-LaserJet_4<br>
https :// developers.hp .com/ hp-linux-imaging-and-printing/KnowledgeBase/Troubleshooting/BasicHPLIPTroubleshooting<br>
https :// bbs.archlinux .org/ viewtopic.php?id=103283<br>
https :// askubuntu .com/ questions/1247245/hp-laser-jet-4-plus-printer (my printer is not the Plus, but I had a look. I get ‘command not found’ for lpinfo -v)</p>
<p>The package page suggests USB support, but nothing about parallel or parallel-to-USB. Neither does the other page. Few people seem to have problems with the LaserJet4 in Debian.<br>
Most pages I saw were problems with printing output rather than with the printer itself. I’m unsure of what to do.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading my post. I appreciate your time. If you need any more information from me, please let me know.</p>

            <p>Greetings,</p>
<p>I am an individual seeking to further harden the security of their laptop.</p>
<p>I found this guide on <code>ansible</code>: <a href="https://bobcares.com/blog/ansible-cis-hardening-debian/" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Ansible CIS Hardening Debian | Setup Tutorial</a></p>
<p>I wanted to know if ansible is incompatible with the Kicksecure project.</p>
<p>What if I don’t care about all the warnings on the wiki concerning the hardened kernel? How could I get the hardened kernel on my system as fast as possible? Should I download the source from <a href="http://kernel.org" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">kernel.org</a> and patch the kernel myself? Or is installing the <code>hardened-kernel</code> package sufficient? Does it do the thing regardless of the current limitations of the project?</p>

<p>Also I used an auditing tool called <code>lynis</code> on a fresh Debian install. The score was 60 for Debian, but after distro morphing to kick secure the score was 67! That’s pretty impressive to me.</p>
<p>Thank you for all your hard work. Do support recurring donations?</p>

          <title>Recent Version of Kicksecure Slow Network Performance</title>

            <p>Hello, I’ve been a big supporter of both Kicksecure and Whonix for many years and noticed that the latest version of Kicksecure with kernel 5.10.XX has noticeably slower network performance compared to older versions.</p>
<p>I’ve tested with Virtualbox and KVM (forward mode bridged &amp; nat).</p>
<p>Has anything changed about the system, in terms of configs, settings or packages relating to networking, that could have caused this?</p>
<p>Regards</p>

          <title>Printer Troubles</title>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hello.</p>
<p>I am having troubles connecting to my Brother HL-L2350DW WiFi printer (no USB; it’s a laptop).  I just installed Kicksecure, so I am trying to figure out <em>why</em> my LibreOffice documents won’t print.  I installed the <code>system-config-printer</code> app to connect to my printer.  I asked the Debian community in another forum what packages I’m missing.  They told me to install some packages from the Debian repos (which they kindly provided), and I obliged.  My printer <em>does show up</em> in the Printer Config app under the Network section when you try to add a printer.</p>
<p>But I cannot connect to it.  Everytime I think I have made a successful connection to my Brother printer, I cannot print a test page.  So I delete the entry and start over again!</p>
<p>I either get 2 things:  The previously mentioned “successful connection”, OR this error message POP-UP <code>CUPS server error. There was an error during the CUPS operation: 'server-error-internal-error'.</code></p>
<p>I have tried disabling CUPS’s AppArmor profiles into complain mode, but still no avail!</p>
<p>I have even tried this solution with Brother’s official “.deb” printer package:</p>
<p>httpswwwlinuxquestionsorgquestions/linux-hardware-18/installation-of-brother-printer-drivers-and-device-uri-number-4175698450</p>
<p>I ultimately believe I am fundamentally encountering a skill issue:  I do not adequately know how to troubleshoot printer problems on Linux.  I don’t know where to look on my system!  Is it <code>/var/logs</code>??  Do I look there?  I know my printer <strong>DOES WORK</strong> because I have successfully printed a CUPS Test Page from Linux Mint.  I just did that 4 weeks ago!</p>
<p>Please help me.  Debian <em>or</em> Kicksecure is kicking my ass.</p>

            <p>When piloting this thing, I wanted to know what are the biggest do’s and don’ts of this software.</p>
<p>Secondly, I’d like a clarification: is the CLI version more secure than the XFCE version? How and why?</p>
<p>Lastly, does the team have any plans for opt-in telemetry? I seek this feature because I am not very technically oriented enough to file bug report. I am learning, but I think automatic bug reports would also be good too.</p>
<p>Do you support recurring donations?</p>

            <p>Greetings Kicksecure Community!</p>
<p>I am an individual who is currently looking for a security-hardened desktop experience for Debian.  I am setting this up for a Windows user (my family member).  The same setup I give them will be the same setup I’ll use on my Debian laptop so I can “look over their shoulder” for any problems they might experience.</p>
<p>I have a few questions for the community.</p>
<p>1.)  Can I install Kicksecure on a Debian-based distro like SpiralLinux?  Please Google. Can’t link website.<br>
2.)  Would it drastically change the settings setup by SpiralLinux?<br>
3.)  Regardless of SpiralLinux, can my family member still use Firefox and Brave comfortably and print stuff off of their wireless Brother printer?  They really need Bluetooth and Printing to work, or this whole thing collapses.<br>
4.)  This security sounds great, but is it “beginner friendly” to maintain?  I still have a life to live.  I’d like to “set it and forget it” if possible.</p>
<p>Here are my needs:</p>
<p>1.)  A Debian distro with Btrfs+Snapper/Timeshift support.<br>
2.)  Full nonfree hardware support.<br>
3.)  Extensive printer support.<br>
4.)  Full Bluetooth support.<br>
5.)  Comfortable web browsing experience.</p>
<p>Nice to Have:<br>
1.)  Messaging services like Signal, Telegram, and WhatsApp on the desktop.</p>
<p>I have used Linux for a long time, but mostly stuck with Ubuntu and EndeavourOS.  I am a Linux novice when it comes to security, but I am willing to read documentation and learn.   Can you help me?  Is Kicksecure right for me and my family?</p>
