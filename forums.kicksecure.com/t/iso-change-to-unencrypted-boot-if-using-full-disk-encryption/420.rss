    <title>ISO: Change to unencrypted /boot if using Full Disk Encryption</title>

    <description>Calamares setting up encrpyted /boot (which gets decrypted with GRUB2) causes many issues.

* GRUB2 needs a very long time to decrypt the root disk.
* Need to enter full disk password twice, at grub boot menu and systemd during boot. This might be a missing dracut module or bug.
* And the worst issue: Keyboard layout issues. There is no way to define keyboard layout during GRUB2 pre-boot full disk encryption password entry. (If there is, these are very complicated, not suitable for a Debian derivative and also break SecureBoot.)

This should be no security issue. This is what most distributions are using. The kernel image is not secret. Unencrypted /boot that Debian (CLI looking) installer (&quot;DI&quot;) is using that too. Encrypted /boot is simply not ready due to these upstream bugs which will very most likely not be resolved anytime soon.

* https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=686817
* https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/index.php?65113

TODO:

* Find a distribution that uses Calamares and implemented unencrypted /boot.
  * Maybe Ubuntu? Check
    *     git clone https://git.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-qt-code/+git/calamares-settings-ubuntu
  * Linux Mint? 
  * Elementary OS?
* Copy over the Calamares config files to Kicksecure (if permissible by the license, which is probably the case).
* Change Kicksecure Calamares Installer to the usual unencrypted /boot partition.</description>
