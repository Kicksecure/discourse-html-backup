    <description>I&#39;m new to this and I&#39;m a bit confused about the differences between Kicksecure and Debian. Can someone please explain this to me and suggest some resources where I can learn more about it?

Additionally, if any forum members have recommendations on where to find more information on how Kicksecure sources.list work, please share them with me. I understand that Kicksecure is designed to enhance the security of Debian.

I had some issues, where fix my reading over the install guide again.</description>
