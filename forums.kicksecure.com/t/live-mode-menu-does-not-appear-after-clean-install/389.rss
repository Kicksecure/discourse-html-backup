    <description>Please help me solve the problem

Clean installation of Debian 12 standard - subsequent distro-morphing in Kicksecure-XFCE exactly according to the instructions 
The Live mode menu does not appear

checking the installation:


```
 dpkg -l | grep grub-live
ii  grub-live                                     3:4.9-1                              all          grub live boot menu entry
ii  grub-live-initramfs-tools                     3:4.9-1                              all          grub live initramfs-tools dependencies
```

That&#39;s where the problem seems to be


```
sudo update-grub

[sudo] password for user:                      
Generating grub configuration file ...
Found linux image: /boot/vmlinuz-6.1.0-18-amd64
Found initrd image: /boot/initrd.img-6.1.0-18-amd64
grub-live /etc/grub.d/11_linux_live: ERROR: It has been detected that this system is using dracut but but file /usr/lib/dracut/modules.d/90overlay-root/overlay-mount.sh is not executable. This means that no live mode boot menu entry will be added.

Warning: os-prober will not be executed to detect other bootable partitions.
Systems on them will not be added to the GRUB boot configuration.
Check GRUB_DISABLE_OS_PROBER documentation entry.

done
```


when I trying `sudo apt install --no-install-recommends dracut` and then` sudo update-grub`, a menu appears but the system does not boot

My goal is just to get a working Kicksecure system on a USB flash drive with LIVE mode

Please tell me the easiest way to get such a system</description>
