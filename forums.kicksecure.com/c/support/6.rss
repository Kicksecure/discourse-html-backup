            <p>I just wanted to clarify that the torified Apt traffic on Kicksecure is only Apt traffic. In that case, if a user wanted to use a VPN client on there desktop would there be any correlation risks?</p>
<p>Or would it be perfectly okay to use a VPN with the torified apt traffic. I guess my concern is that if I’m using a paid VPN with my identity and torified Apt traffic, I don’t want that to be correlated.</p>
<p>Have I understood this correctly?</p>

            <p>Please excuse the throwaway account. I just want to anonymously report this issue:<br>
After upgrading Whonix (/Kicksecure) from bullseye to bookworm with the release-upgrade script provided, the livecheck.sh script will allways detect that there is something mounted in read-write (and therefore show this in the systray). This is due to the weird fact, that since bookworm, lsblk -all shows empty loop devices from 0-7 that are all read-write and hence trigger livecheck.sh to believe the system is mounted in read-write.<br>
I was not able to understand why these loop devices are present in bookworm.</p>
<p>This all occurs with the system correctly being mounted in read-only and started with grub-live, therefore confusing users.</p>

          <title>Performance. How do I turn SMT back on?</title>

            <p>Hello.</p>
<p>My laptop is just an old toaster; it is a very low powered machine.  I currently cannot handle the security features of having SMT turned off.  I understand turning it back on poses a greater security risk, but at this point I’d rather have a functional laptop.</p>
<p>How do I turn SMT back on?  Please save my old toaster!  My Old Trusty really needs that hyperthreading again.  Intel Core i5 (3rd generation) dual core + hyperthreading.</p>
<p>I think you guys have done wonders as far as security is concerned for the Linux desktop, and I pray for your continued success.</p>
<p>I wish adding your Kicksecure repo to an immutable distro like Vanilla OS was a simple and easy process.  Having atomic updates with Kicksecure’s security layering would be my absolute dreamboat Linux distro!</p>

          <title>Hardware detection problems: CD-ROM (special device /dev/sr0 does not exist) and HP LaserJet 4 printer (hplip does not detect)</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[ratatat]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Support</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Computer:	Lenovo Thinkpad T500<br>
OS:		Kicksecure (distromorph)(latest version)<br>
DE:		Xfce<br>
Printer:	HP LaserJet 4<br>
CD Drive:	Thinkpad Ultrabay</p>
<p>I have a laptop on which I recently re-installed the Kicksecure. It is a distromorph from a fresh re-installation of the latest version of Debian.<br>
I have never been able to get the DVD/CD-RW drive to work. When I insert a CD or DVD, I hear the drive whirring, but nothing pops up on the desktop.  If I type ‘sudo thunar’ into the terminal, I am able to see the drive in the sidebar, but if I try to mount it, it tells me the following:</p>
<p>Failed to mount “cdrom0”.<br>
mount: /media/cdrom0: special device /dev/sr0 does not exist.</p>
<p>Before morphing this installation, I tested a CD to make sure the drive was functional. On Debian, the CD popped up on the desktop and I was about to mount the drive. It seems to be the morph into Kicksecure which causes the problem. As a security-focused distro, I assume it is intentional.</p>
<p>A similar problem occurs with my printer. It is an HP LaserJet 4, a printer known for its GNU/Linux-friendliness. As it uses a parallel port, I used a parallel-to-USB adapter I had lying around the house. I read somewhere that some units use blobs, so I also bought a parallel-to USB adapter from ThinkPenguin which does not use proprietary firmware blobs, so I don’t believe it contributes to the problem. I installed hp-lip and attemtped to set-up the printer, but the discovery tool doesn’t detect it. Here is what I have done so far:</p>
<p>-I tested both adapters. Nothing.<br>
-I checked dmesg to see if the printer appears. I don’t see anything in particular which looks like something has been plugged in. Could it be because it’s a parallel-to-USB connection instead of a regular USB device? I have no other parallel devices to test.<br>
-I restarted the computer with the printer plugged in and turned on and checked dmesg again as well as running hp-setup. Still nothing.</p>
<p>I was unable to test the printer on Debian before the morph, but I wanted to know if anyone has had a similar problem. Post-morph, other USB devices such as external HDDs, USB drives, and a webcam work with no issue. The only other USB device which has trouble with recognition…is an external CD drive. I assume the permissions for external and internal CD drives are the same, so it traces its roots to the first problem.</p>
<p>Before posting, I had a look through the docs under the following pages which I thought might give me clues:</p>
<p>-Printing and Scanning (page returned blank)<br>
-System Configuration and Access<br>
-Advanced Host Security<br>
-Operating System Hardening<br>
-Protection Against Physical Attacks<br>
-Troubleshooting<br>
-Full Disk Encryption<br>
-Malware, Computer Viruses, Firmware Trojans and Antivirus Scanners</p>
<p>I tried these search terms:</p>
<p>failed to mount cdrom0 mount: /media/cdrom0: special device /dev/sr0 does not exist error debian<br>
failed to mount cdrom0 mount: /media/cdrom0: special device /dev/sr0 does not exist error kicksecure<br>
cdrom0 error kicksecure<br>
cdrom0 error debian<br>
sr0 does not exist kicksecure<br>
sr0 does not exist debian</p>
<p>hplip debian laserjet 4<br>
hplip kicksecure laserjet 4<br>
hp-setup kicksecure<br>
hp-setup debian<br>
hp laserjet 4 no recognition dmesg<br>
hp laserjet 4 no discovery hplip usb</p>
<p>For the CD-ROM:<br>
After killing the CSS on this page, I followed the instructions verbatim. I still returned the original error in bash after completing them. Perhaps it’s because RHEL differs in its notation than Debian? If so, how do I modify it?<br>
https :// www . ibm . com/support/pages/linux-error-mount-special-device-devcdrom-does-not-exist-cd-rom-drive-ibm-eserver-bladecenter</p>
<p>This page did not load for me. I suspect Cloudflare usage, as I’m on Tor Browser with Javascript disabled.<br>
https :// www . linuxquestions . org /questions/linux-hardware-18/mount-special-device-dev-cdrom-does-not-exist-21369/</p>
<p>Same error as before:<br>
https :// linuxconfig . org /how-to-mount-cdrom-in-linux</p>
<p>For the Printer:<br>
https :// packages.debian .org/ bullseye/hplip<br>
https :// www.openprinting .org/ printer/HP/HP-LaserJet_4<br>
https :// developers.hp .com/ hp-linux-imaging-and-printing/KnowledgeBase/Troubleshooting/BasicHPLIPTroubleshooting<br>
https :// bbs.archlinux .org/ viewtopic.php?id=103283<br>
https :// askubuntu .com/ questions/1247245/hp-laser-jet-4-plus-printer (my printer is not the Plus, but I had a look. I get ‘command not found’ for lpinfo -v)</p>
<p>The package page suggests USB support, but nothing about parallel or parallel-to-USB. Neither does the other page. Few people seem to have problems with the LaserJet4 in Debian.<br>
Most pages I saw were problems with printing output rather than with the printer itself. I’m unsure of what to do.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading my post. I appreciate your time. If you need any more information from me, please let me know.</p>

            <p>Greetings,</p>
<p>I am an individual seeking to further harden the security of their laptop.</p>
<p>I found this guide on <code>ansible</code>: <a href="https://bobcares.com/blog/ansible-cis-hardening-debian/" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Ansible CIS Hardening Debian | Setup Tutorial</a></p>
<p>I wanted to know if ansible is incompatible with the Kicksecure project.</p>
<p>What if I don’t care about all the warnings on the wiki concerning the hardened kernel? How could I get the hardened kernel on my system as fast as possible? Should I download the source from <a href="http://kernel.org" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">kernel.org</a> and patch the kernel myself? Or is installing the <code>hardened-kernel</code> package sufficient? Does it do the thing regardless of the current limitations of the project?</p>

<p>Also I used an auditing tool called <code>lynis</code> on a fresh Debian install. The score was 60 for Debian, but after distro morphing to kick secure the score was 67! That’s pretty impressive to me.</p>

            <p>Hello, I’ve been a big supporter of both Kicksecure and Whonix for many years and noticed that the latest version of Kicksecure with kernel 5.10.XX has noticeably slower network performance compared to older versions.</p>
<p>I’ve tested with Virtualbox and KVM (forward mode bridged &amp; nat).</p>
<p>Has anything changed about the system, in terms of configs, settings or packages relating to networking, that could have caused this?</p>
<p>Regards</p>

          <title>Printer Troubles</title>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hello.</p>
<p>I am having troubles connecting to my Brother HL-L2350DW WiFi printer (no USB; it’s a laptop).  I just installed Kicksecure, so I am trying to figure out <em>why</em> my LibreOffice documents won’t print.  I installed the <code>system-config-printer</code> app to connect to my printer.  I asked the Debian community in another forum what packages I’m missing.  They told me to install some packages from the Debian repos (which they kindly provided), and I obliged.  My printer <em>does show up</em> in the Printer Config app under the Network section when you try to add a printer.</p>
<p>But I cannot connect to it.  Everytime I think I have made a successful connection to my Brother printer, I cannot print a test page.  So I delete the entry and start over again!</p>
<p>I either get 2 things:  The previously mentioned “successful connection”, OR this error message POP-UP <code>CUPS server error. There was an error during the CUPS operation: 'server-error-internal-error'.</code></p>
<p>I have tried disabling CUPS’s AppArmor profiles into complain mode, but still no avail!</p>
<p>I have even tried this solution with Brother’s official “.deb” printer package:</p>
<p>httpswwwlinuxquestionsorgquestions/linux-hardware-18/installation-of-brother-printer-drivers-and-device-uri-number-4175698450</p>
<p>I ultimately believe I am fundamentally encountering a skill issue:  I do not adequately know how to troubleshoot printer problems on Linux.  I don’t know where to look on my system!  Is it <code>/var/logs</code>??  Do I look there?  I know my printer <strong>DOES WORK</strong> because I have successfully printed a CUPS Test Page from Linux Mint.  I just did that 4 weeks ago!</p>
<p>Please help me.  Debian <em>or</em> Kicksecure is kicking my ass.</p>

            <p>When piloting this thing, I wanted to know what are the biggest do’s and don’ts of this software.</p>
<p>Secondly, I’d like a clarification: is the CLI version more secure than the XFCE version? How and why?</p>
<p>Lastly, does the team have any plans for opt-in telemetry? I seek this feature because I am not very technically oriented enough to file bug report. I am learning, but I think automatic bug reports would also be good too.</p>
<p>Do you support recurring donations?</p>

            <p>Greetings Kicksecure Community!</p>
<p>I am an individual who is currently looking for a security-hardened desktop experience for Debian.  I am setting this up for a Windows user (my family member).  The same setup I give them will be the same setup I’ll use on my Debian laptop so I can “look over their shoulder” for any problems they might experience.</p>
<p>I have a few questions for the community.</p>
<p>1.)  Can I install Kicksecure on a Debian-based distro like SpiralLinux?  Please Google. Can’t link website.<br>
2.)  Would it drastically change the settings setup by SpiralLinux?<br>
3.)  Regardless of SpiralLinux, can my family member still use Firefox and Brave comfortably and print stuff off of their wireless Brother printer?  They really need Bluetooth and Printing to work, or this whole thing collapses.<br>
4.)  This security sounds great, but is it “beginner friendly” to maintain?  I still have a life to live.  I’d like to “set it and forget it” if possible.</p>
<p>Here are my needs:</p>
<p>1.)  A Debian distro with Btrfs+Snapper/Timeshift support.<br>
2.)  Full nonfree hardware support.<br>
3.)  Extensive printer support.<br>
4.)  Full Bluetooth support.<br>
5.)  Comfortable web browsing experience.</p>
<p>Nice to Have:<br>
1.)  Messaging services like Signal, Telegram, and WhatsApp on the desktop.</p>
<p>I have used Linux for a long time, but mostly stuck with Ubuntu and EndeavourOS.  I am a Linux novice when it comes to security, but I am willing to read documentation and learn.   Can you help me?  Is Kicksecure right for me and my family?</p>

            <p>Hi community,<br>
I’m having difficulties getting the GUI package of kicksecure on my Qubes system. I followed the instructions on how to make a clone of the Debian template and install kicksecure from there on the terminal.</p>
<p>I am reading instructions on the page “install kicksecure inside Debian”. I got to step 2 C. on “Install the Kicksecure Package”, where it says to run the command to install <em>kicksecure-cli-host</em>. Naturally I replaced this with <em><strong>kicksecure-qubes-gui</strong></em> because that’s the package I want to download - I want the user firendly GUI one.</p>
<p>When I entered that, it simply said “unable to locate package kicksecure-qubes-gui”. Keep in mind I followed all the other steps on the page?</p>
<p>Can someone help get me unstuck? Thanks!</p>

            <p>Hello!  I’m still new to KickSecure but I’m running it inside a VM so that I can use VPN at a public library, pretty awesome.  Trying to install the nice OpenVPN GUI and I’m getting permission denied for adding their key or modifying sources.list and I just don’t know why permission is denied.  What can I do?</p>

            <p>I was going through all the steps to morph Debian 11 to KS and hit a snag at the very last part. While running “sudo apt install kicksecure-xfce” it hits an error "/var/lib/dpkg/tmp.ci/preinst: ERROR: No user is a member of group ‘sudo’. Installation aborted.</p>
<p>I followed the guidance for not making user sudo due to a preference to keep root the only admin account.</p>
<p>Is it possible to use the xfce installer without having user in sudo?</p>

            <p>Hello, dear users and developers!</p>
<p>I have a question. Is it possible/wise/endorsed-by-developers to use Kicksecure XFCE OS in VirtualBox as completely offline virtual machine for cold storage? If the answer is “yes”, then how to properly configure both virtual machine and Kicksecure settings for that purpose?</p>
<p>Is it enough to just disable network in VirtualBox settings for Kicksecure?<br>
Or should I also disable such things as System Check and sdwdate inside Kicksecure somehow since there is no internet connection anyway? Which time should I set in such case to be secure?</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your work on Whonix, and for your answer in advance too! <img src="//forums.kicksecure.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Problem with hardended_malloc</p>
<p>Installed packages kicksecure-xfce and hardened malloc following instructions from website, original system is debian stable, kernel from backports.</p>
<p>When using hardened malloc light does not start xorg, throws in CLI. Logs attached. When I run ld-system-preload-disable startx from the CLI, xorg works. It also works if I remove the hardened malloc light. What to do?</p>
