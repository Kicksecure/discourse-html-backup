            <p>I’m new to this and I’m a bit confused about the differences between Kicksecure and Debian. Can someone please explain this to me and suggest some resources where I can learn more about it?</p>
<p>Additionally, if any forum members have recommendations on where to find more information on how Kicksecure sources.list work, please share them with me. I understand that Kicksecure is designed to enhance the security of Debian.</p>
<p>I had some issues, where fixed by reading over the install guide again.</p>

            <p>Trying to apply kicksecure’s hardenings to Parrot Home edition (Vbox), but i ran into some problems. Here is the output:<br>
sudo apt install --no-install-recommends kicksecure-cli-vm<br>
Reading package lists… Done<br>
Building dependency tree… Done<br>
Reading state information… Done<br>
Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have<br>
requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable<br>
distribution that some required packages have not yet been created<br>
or been moved out of Incoming.<br>
The following information may help to resolve the situation:</p>
<p>The following packages have unmet dependencies:<br>
kicksecure-recommended-cli : Depends: libblockdev-crypto2 but it is not installable<br>
plymouth : Conflicts: console-common but 0.7.91 is to be installed<br>
: Error, pkgProblemResolver::Resolve generated breaks, this may be caused by held packages.</p>
<p>Already tried and searched for many solutions, but none of them really solved my problem. Someone can help me?</p>

            <p>on a debian 12 install, I configured NFS for use on my local LAN. I did intsall network-manager-gnome and openvpn…</p>
<p>after my client was able to mount the remote (local LAN). after installing kicksecure, I cannot get them to connect.</p>
<p>connection timeout when trying to mount from the command line.</p>
<p>I have double shecked hosts.allow and exports on the server, but they didnt seem to have been altered by installing kicksecure.</p>
<p>I DO have multiple NIC installed (4). 2 in use to WAN via router1, and 1 in use to router2 (local LAN)</p>
<p>portlist shows tcp 2049<br>
rpcinfo shows<br>
portmapper ports 111 TCP &amp; UDP for versions 2,3,4<br>
nfs ports 2049 TCP versions 3 &amp; 4, and a nfs_acl on 2049 for version 3</p>
<p>ideally i would prefer to have an IP or MAC verified w/o kerberos, but I will take what I can at the moment I cant get mount working…</p>

            <p>How do I install a minimal Kicksecure environment? I don’t need Tor, fonts or xserver but <code>kicksecure-cli</code> force me to install a lot of unnecessary packages. Is there anyway that allows me to install a minimal Kicksecure environment? I also don’t need swap at all, why it creates a swap partition for me?<br>
I think we need a <code>kicksecure-minimum</code> metapackage without Tor, fonts or any thing like <code>p7zip</code> or <code>libgtk</code>.</p>

            <p>Bookworm-based kicksecure-qubes-cli in Qubes 4.2:<br>
Seemingly after applying the massive Kicksecure refresh on December 18, previously-working OpenVPN says it can’t connect to the VPN servers.<br>
OpenVPN is used from network-manager, but the “Can’t connect”  messages are also seen if running openvpn directly in terminal.</p>
<p>Deleting and re-configuring the VPN connection didn’t help.<br>
The firewall rules look the same as before.<br>
Spent time troubleshooting and ended up rebuilding the template. Found out that this VPN setup works OK if the Kicksecure updates are not applied.<br>
It also works OK on older, bullseye-based Kicksecure, which didn’t get the recent hardening updates.</p>
<p>Did something just change with the hardening of services, firewall, config files, apparmor, etc.?<br>
I’d like to eventually resume getting the kicksecure updates. Any advice?</p>

            <p>Hello Kicksecure team,</p>
<p>I noticed that live-mode in a VM virtualbox is not functionning as intented from my personnal setup. I’m using Ubuntu as Host and Kicksecure is installed in a VM (2 cases: VM import from Kicksecure + Debian cli minimal install with Kicksecure installed manually on it).</p>
<p>*Here is the issue (for both cases)<br>
1/ Boot in live mode<br>
2/ Create a folder + texte file in /home/user and save it.<br>
3/ Shutdown the VM<br>
4/ Reboot in live mode<br>
5/ The folder &amp; files are still there.</p>
<p>*Some other infos:<br>
1/ I did this multiple times with the same result<br>
2/ I also completely shutdown my ubuntu host.<br>
3/ Synaptic and ClamAV packages installed.</p>
<p>*Is it then an issue from me or are you able to replicate this?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Why does this happen? No one has explained.</p>
