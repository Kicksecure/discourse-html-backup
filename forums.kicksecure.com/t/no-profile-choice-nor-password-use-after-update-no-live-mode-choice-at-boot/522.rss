    <title>No profile choice nor password use after update &amp; no Live Mode choice at boot</title>

    <description>Hello everyone and thank you in advance for your help!

I installed a few months ago Kicksecure on Debian 12 and everything was working fine except since a recent update performed with sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt full-upgrade -y.
Before this one, after the boot procedure I arrived on the window where to choose my login, I entered my profile name and password and arrived on the desktop. Now, after booting, I arrive directly on the desktop of a profile that is &quot;user&quot; without a password, and I have to log out to return to the choice window and enter my login and password to use my usual profile.
Furthermore, after boot and automatic connection without login, I opened a browser which automatically displayed the /wiki/Live_Mode page and I saw that at boot I don&#39;t have the choice of Live Mode.
I don&#39;t understand what&#39;s happened and despite my research I haven&#39;t found how to restore the profile choice window after boot, nor how to have the Live Mode choice at boot. 
Your advice is most welcome!
