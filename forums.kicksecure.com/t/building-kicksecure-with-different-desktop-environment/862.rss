    <description>Apologies, I accidentally posted on Whonix Forums.

Hi everyone,

I&#39;m trying to get Wayland working with Kicksecure/KVM.

Installing a Wayland compositor like sway or labwc in XFCE Kicksecure is not an option, due to the qemu bug which rotates the cursor by 180 degress. This happens with any DE that doesn’t fully integrate Wayland. (sway issue #6581 on git)

Using Kicksecure with LXQT or KDE which have native Wayland support fixes that issue. (already tested with CLI Version)

Can I simply replace or add a few packages in Derivative-Maker to achieve this?

Looks like `derivative-maker/packages/kicksecure/kicksecure-meta-packages/debian/control`, lists the following meta-packages and their dependencies (containing all xfce packages) which could be changed to install LXQT instead of XFCE:

```
kicksecure-xfce
kicksecure-desktop-applications-xfce
kicksecure-desktop-environment-essential-xfce
kicksecure-shared-host-xfce
.......etc
```
For example:
```
xfce4 &gt; lxqt
mousepad &gt; featherpad
xfce4-terminal &gt; qterminal
....etc
```
After some more digging the variable `dist_build_script_build_dependency` in `build-steps.d/1200_prepare-build-machine` contains all the packages listed in `kicksecure-meta-packages/debian/control`.

I keep seeing `&quot;$@&quot;` in  `3500_install-packages` later on, so I&#39;m assuming some of the packages are passed as an argument to the install functions.

My plan would be to either switch the xfce packages to lxqt in `/kicksecure/kicksecure-meta-packages/debian/control` or if that&#39;s no good then sed replace them in the variable that holds all install dependencies.

Finally, config stuff seems to be handled by `derivative-maker/packages/kicksecure/desktop-config-dist`. There I’d just replace `/etc/skel/.config` xmls with lxqt ones.

Is that pretty much it or am I missing something?

Kind regards</description>

            <p>How does the whisker menu compare to the menu that LXQT uses?<br>
I like xfce due to its lightweightness but I do not like the whisker menu compaired to other DE application menus.</p>

            <p>Hello, thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>I read the entire code again and things are getting clearer now. <img src="https://forums.kicksecure.com/images/emoji/twitter/face_with_peeking_eye.png?v=12" title=":face_with_peeking_eye:" class="emoji" alt=":face_with_peeking_eye:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>

<p>Thanks, so <code>flavor_meta_packages_to_install</code> is defined in <code>help-steps/variables</code> and (among other variables) called with source, which is used in every build step. (That took me a while to see)</p>

<p>Are you looking for a hacky custom solution or implementing this properly and upstreaming to Kicksecure?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the hacky solution I’d just follow your suggestion with <code>flavor_meta_packages_to_install="kicksecure-cli-vm"</code> (or exclude specific xfce packages via <code>dist_build_script_skip_package_install</code>) and install the new lxqt packages with <code>pkg_install_list=lxqt-pkg1 lxqt-pkg2.....</code></p>
<p>I’d be happy to help if you guys are interested in kicksecure-lxqt meta-packages.<br>
I already started replacing all the dependencies in the control file before.</p>
<p>Those should be the new ones (if I didn’t miss anything):</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">kicksecure-lxqt, kicksecure-desktop-applications-lxqt, kicksecure-desktop-environment-essential-lxqt, kicksecure-lxqt-host, kicksecure-lxqt-vm, kicksecure-shared-host-xfce`
</code></pre>
<p>Minimal LXQT is probably superior to XFCE in terms of resource requirements anyway and Wayland support is a nice bonus.</p>
<p>I read <code>build-steps.d/3500_install-packages</code> a bunch of times but couldn’t find a function that “installs” all the stuff from <code>derivative-maker/packages/kicksecure/*</code>. Where does this actually happen?</p>
<p>For example, <code>3500_install-packages</code>  install_packages() function copies the apt binary directly from that directory, but <code>4300_run-chroot-scripts-post-d</code> already expects <code>/usr/libexec/initializer-dist/chroot-scripts-post.d</code> to be there from the initializer-dist package.</p>

<p>For a proper solution, new meta packages need to be invented and contributed to kicksecure-meta-packages.</p>
