    <title>Metapackages tweak suggestions</title>
    <link>https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/metapackages-tweak-suggestions/663</link>
    <description>Looked through Kicksecure&#39;s metapackages to see what depends on what, and determine if some enhancements could be made. I added a rather lengthy suggestion for restructuring the metapackages to https://www.kicksecure.com/w/index.php?title=Dev/Metapackages&amp;stable=0, which would be something we could consider for Trixie. While Kicksecure is still based on Bookworm however, I came up with some possibly useful changes we could apply now:

* Add `apt-transport-https` to `kicksecure-dependencies-cli`? This will make it easier for people to use certain third-party repos, potentially.
* Does `timesanitycheck` need updated? It&#39;s &quot;expiration date&quot; is some time in 2023.
* Consider adding `vim-tiny` or even `vim` to `kicksecure-recommended-cli`? `nano` is oftentimes tricky to use for me, and I spin up new VMs often enough that installing Vim later is something I have to keep redoing.
* Does `open-link-confirmation` still work? If so, I notice that the Git page for it (https://github.com/Kicksecure/open-link-confirmation) states &quot;On an Anonymity Gateway (when the `anon-gw-base-files` package is installed), it honors the `$EDITOR` environment variable (falls back to kwrite if unset), asks if a file should be opened in an editor before opening it and informs, that opening links on a Gateway is unsupported for security reasons.&quot; Maybe the default text editor should be changed to Mousepad?
* Why are the following packages part of `kicksecure-default-applications-cli`, shouldn&#39;t they be part of a GUI metapackage instead, like `kicksecure-desktop-applications-xfce`?
  * `catfish` (appears to be primarily a GUI application)
  * `flatpak` (flatpaks are only supposed to be GUI applications)
Why are the following applications part of `kicksecure-desktop-applications-xfce`, shouldn&#39;t they be part of a CLI package like `kicksecure-recommended-cli` or `kicksecure-default-applications-cli`?
  * `p7zip-full`
  * `unar`
  * `unzip`
  * `xz-utils`
  * `zip`
* CLI/TUI tools can use `hunspell` (nano for instance has spell checking functionality that uses it according to `apt-cache rdepends`), should it be moved from kicksecure-desktop-applications-recommended to `kicksecure-recommended-cli` or even `kicksecure-dependencies-cli`? (The latter has a &quot;Do not remove.&quot; warning similar to `kicksecure-desktop-applications-recommended`).
* Hexchat is officially abandoned upstream. See https://hexchat.github.io/news/2.16.2.html. Might be a good idea to find a different IRC client and make an apparmor-profile package for it, since Hexchat may not be secure in the long run?
* tirdad may actually be useful under Qubes OS, assuming the VM runs its own kernel which I think it does (although there is a Qubes OS setting that makes me unsure there). If it is usable on Qubes, perhaps it should be moved from `kicksecure-cli-host-packages-recommended` to `kicksecure-recommended-cli` or even `kicksecure-dependencies-cli`? This needs testing.

Assuming no one brings up any objections, I&#39;ll be submitting some changes for review that implement some or all of the above.</description>

<p>Recommended vs dependencies is arguable. Not sure.</p>
<p>But as long as inside VM kernel isn’t the default, I think this would break.</p>

<p>This is working now but dependent on Qubes host kernel. In the past, tirdad broke on newer kernel versions. Since tirdad does not work without inside VM kernel inside Qubes and has the potential to brreak APT and since setting up inside VM kernel inside Qubes is difficult, I think it’s best to not install tirdad by default in Qubes.</p>
