        <title>Getting some strange errors in Whonix on a new PC</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@Kobrakai]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>I’ve been using Whonix which is based on Kicksecure for many years but I just got a new PC and now I’m having problems booting it in VirtualBox. I tried posting this on the Whonix forums but they suggested I ask here.</p>
<p>Sometimes it will boot correctly and sometimes it will get stuck. I’m often seeing strange errors/warnings around where it gets stuck which could be related. Unfortunately this forum won’t allow me to post a link or upload an image.</p>
<p>The errors seem to refer to the CPU so it might be worth mentioning I have an AMD Ryzen 7 9800x3d which has only just come out recently. Is there a known issue with this CPU?</p> ]]></description>

<p>Not sure if thats the issue but if it is then its unsolvable by default. we try to avoid systemd as much as possible and this looks like app specific change so you need to figure out how to set apps needs on the OS.</p> ]]></description>

<blockquote>
<p>We should make sure this doesn’t break Recovery Mode, that’s the only thing wrong I can think of with that.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Actually i would argue against that, why do we need to rely on recovery mode?</p>
<p>I think of recovery mode ability is like backdooring your own OS, what we need to do is that change the mentality of how user reacting with OS:</p>
<p>Since we are moving towards btrfs/snapshot feature this will reduce the reliability on recovery mode.</p>
<p>Other thing is that think about a mobile phone got whatever issue to the boot of the OS, yes it has recovery mode but very unlikely users gonna figure out how to use it let alone if its even possible to have any usefulness when entering recovery mode as it will just allow you to reinstall the OS…</p>
<p>So how to solve this? another mental change to the user that he should always backup his own data to his own hardware and that can be his own flash/hard drive, or internal clould (NAS/Nexcloud…etc) or even external server… something he choose but the OS will not backdoor itself for recovery mode.</p>
<p>Note: booting into recovery mode is a malicious boot up of the system, because it will be booting with minimalistic services meaning will disable almost all security features that user needs, other word its just the wrong method in nowadays time.</p> ]]></description>

<p>Generally, I am also not sure Twitter / X is a suitable place for a productive conversation.</p>
<p>If I had to guess, I would say that this is in retaliation for:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Mobile_Operating_System_Comparison" class="inline-onebox">Mobile Operating System Comparison</a> chapter <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Mobile_Operating_System_Comparison#GrapheneOS">GrapheneOS</a>, which is factual, backed with sources/references, but unwelcome criticism. (Discussion here: <a href="https://forums.whonix.org/t/overview-of-mobile-projects-that-focus-on-either-and-or-security-privacy-anonymity-source-available-freedom-software/4557/48" class="inline-onebox">Overview of Mobile Projects - That focus on either/and/or security, privacy, anonymity, source-available, Freedom Software. - #48 by TommyTran732 - News - Whonix Forum</a>) And maybe,</li>

</ul>
<p>That tweet might have been in context of <a href="https://privsec.dev/posts/linux/choosing-your-desktop-linux-distribution/" class="inline-onebox">Choosing Your Desktop Linux Distribution | PrivSec - A practical approach to Privacy and Security</a> because another commenter has posted it in that thread (<a href="https://xcancel.com/iAnonymous3000/status/1861464122405110098#m">https://xcancel.com/iAnonymous3000/status/1861464122405110098#m</a>) and then the author referring to “encrypted swap”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Kicksecure/Whonix doesn’t do any significant hardening</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can imagine how one could come to such a mistaken conclusion, if not having reviewed:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/#security">Kicksecure homepage, security</a>,</li>
<li><a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/About" class="inline-onebox">Kicksecure - A Security Hardened Linux Distribution</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Dev/Strong_Linux_User_Account_Isolation" class="inline-onebox">Strong Linux User Account Isolation</a>,</li>

<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>They sabotaged security efforts</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They’re entitled to their opinion but I would suggest when critizing others, making grandiose accusations, it should always be backed up with actual evidence.</p>
<p>Better:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They sabotaged security efforts [1]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>[1] exact link/reference + exact quotation</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Otherwise, one first need to ask for clarification what this is even about.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>and the efforts to do that were stalled and then rolled back when the person responsible for most of it left the project.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If this is about <a href="https://github.com/madaidan" class="inline-onebox">madaidan · GitHub</a>, then it can be seen that madaidan’s github activity completely ceased in 2022, not only related to Kicksecure/Whonix.</p>
<p>Related: <a href="https://github.com/madaidans-insecurities/madaidans-insecurities.github.io/issues/77" class="inline-onebox">Is this project still maintained? · Issue #77 · madaidans-insecurities/madaidans-insecurities.github.io · GitHub</a></p>
<p>So this can hardly be blamed on Kicksecure/Whonix.</p>

        <title>GrapheneOS Attacks Kicksecure! What should the response be?</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@privacy]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <blockquote>
<p>Kicksecure is awful. Has a horrible choice of base OS for security and they don’t do valuable work to improve it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Who is they?</p>
<p>You mean not very many people are contributing enough or working on Kicksecure is what that translates to?<br>
The claim that Kicksecure “doesn’t do valuable work to improve it” overlooks the contributions made by the project in terms of privacy and security enhancements. Kicksecure integrates various security features and tools that are designed to protect user anonymity and data, which can be valuable in the context of its intended use.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They sabotaged security efforts and are spreading misinformation about allocator hardening and other topics they don’t understand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The understanding I have is it breaking Xorg and both Whonix/Kicksecure use Xfce. Again who is they who is sabotaging security efforts, do they mean more like little to no people working on it compared to GrapheneOS?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Secureblue is doing useful work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ok, some of those things look like they could be ported or looked at on Kicksecure/Whonix but take in mind this Secureblue is a Fedora project.</p>
<p>Kicksecure strives to be hardened Debian or rather what Debian out of the box should be. If you have ever manually hardened your Debian installs you understand how valuable Kicksecure or rather the repository is.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Someone making an equivalent out of Fedora Silverblue or Arch would obsolete it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again the focus on the base system is Debian.<br>
This is not a Fedora based distro or Arch.</p>
<p>Silverblue uses two things for containerization Podman and Flatpak, but primarily uses Podman for containerization. Podman may be something for Kicksecure/Whonix to look into, but in regards to Flatpak I’m someone who will always avoid it because I think Flatpak is utter trash.</p>
<p>Silverblue and Android both use SELinux. SELinux is more complex then AppArmor but might be better but requires lots of configuration and policy management. Take in mind another Privacy/Security distro Tails doesn’t use SELinux but rather AppArmor instead.</p>
<p>Also as stated by Daniel Micay:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>AppArmor is extremely limited in what it can do compared to SELinux. Ubuntu integrated of App Armor and the Fedora and RHEL integration of SELinux barely does anything though. That’s not particularly serious SELinux integration and barely does anything for a desktop setup at all.</p>

<p>Presumably, you all disagree with Daniel Micay / GrapheneOS. What is the rebuttal here?</p>

</aside>
<p>Well I will say this Daniel Micay always has always acted like everyone is out to get him.<br>
Unlike Daniel Micay, the main dev that maintains Whonix/Kicksecure <a class="mention" href="https://forums.kicksecure.com/u/patrick">@Patrick</a> is the one holding up the project isn’t attacking others and acting like everyone is out to get them.<br>
It’s important to recognize the challenges that come with being the primary maintainer of a project. Burnout can be a real issue for those who are responsible for testing and developing software, and this can impact the pace of progress. Patrick’s ability to navigate these challenges while fostering a positive environment speaks to his character and dedication to the project. I have never felt anything other then a  toxic or rather elitist feeling then when I have talked to those in the GrapheneOS space, I don’t feel that reflects their developers, but rather their community. I don’t get that feeling in the Kicksecure/Whonix community.</p>
<p>The only thing I guess I could agree with him on is his/her’s tweet is mention of Wayland and I think a top priority of Kicksecure/Whonix would be swiching to Wayland and a different Desktop Environment instead of Xfce. As it currently stands Xfce doesn’t have Wayland support. I don’t know how Hardened Malloc works with Wayland but once the switch then it could be ported. Whonix workstation and Kicksecure could be better but this involves research/testing and you know like more people contributing, which Daniel fails to mention.</p> ]]></description>

        <title>VPN does not work after installing Kicksecure</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@linuxer]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>All apps work - telegram, whatsapp, signal, browser (except tor without tor). As soon as you uninstall kicksecure and pure vpn instantly connects to servers. That’s why I am asking which kicksecure package can affect internet? You can install tor in kicksecure, then disable tor network: network.dns.disabled ⇒ false extensions.torlauncher.start_tor ⇒ false network.proxy.socks ⇒ _ and this browser won’t work, but it work in default debian-ubuntu. If you can launch this browser, it will launch a pure vpn. I knew for sure that security-misk, tirdad, sdwdate packages were definitely not related to this problem</p> ]]></description>

<p>I should have been more clear - I’m trying to find out if DNS is working for other apps or not. It sounds like it probably is, but just so we can be completely sure, can you share the output of <code>dig kicksecure.com</code>?</p>
<p>Finally, other users of PureVPN have noticed “connection timed out” errors that didn’t have anything to do with DNS.

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>To begin with, I’d recommend running <code>sudo apt install --no-install-recommends kicksecure-cli-host</code> to put back at least most of the packages you’ve tried removing. Without knowing what you removed, it’s hard to know whether you’ve potentially weakened the system’s security or not.</p>
<p>Next, the DNS stuff. Right now I’m not totally sure that DNS is actually the problem, and if it is, it’s unclear what’s wrong with it, so I need to ask you for some more information.</p>
<ul>
<li>Can you share the contents of your <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> file? This file indicates what DNS server the system is using. I <em>do</em> need to see the IP addresses in this file, since they tell me what DNS servers the system is configured to use. Unless your network is very badly misconfigured, or you’re hosting your own public DNS server in your house, those IP addresses won’t be usable to locate or identify you, and thus should be safe to share publicly. You can look up any IP addresses you see to make extra sure.</li>
<li>Is the computer able to connect to websites without a VPN?</li>
<li>What is the output of <code>dpkg-query -s systemd-resolved</code>?</li>
<li>Does “pure-vpn” have logs you can share that could help us understand what’s wrong a little bit better?</li>
</ul>
<p>I have an idea for a fix, but let’s start with that and see where things go from there.</p> ]]></description>

<p>Secureblue is doing useful work.</p>
<p>The concept used by Whonix for forcing traffic through Tor makes sense but the OS has awful security, just like the Tor Browser itself having awful security. Someone making an equivalent out of Fedora Silverblue or Arch would obsolete it.</p>
<p>Kicksecure/Whonix doesn’t do any significant hardening and the efforts to do that were stalled and then rolled back when the person responsible for most of it left the project. It has some minor anonymity changes easily done elsewhere. Encrypted swap is widely used elsewhere.</p>

<p>Sure, I get that and I respect that. But at the same time, it sounded like you had done experimentation on unsupported but still likely-to-work platforms, and ran into problems on a fully supported platform (i.e. distro-morphing vanilla Debian). Naturally this is concerning, so we did some bug hunting to see if we could reproduce the issue the same way.</p>
<p>Before I go and try to install Debian with KDE Plasma, could you please tell me <strong>which release of Debian are you using?</strong> You can find out by running <code>cat /etc/os-release</code> in a terminal. Please share the entire <code>VERSION</code> variable shown in the command’s output.</p> ]]></description>

        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@sam]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>We use standard debian. I dont even know where to find other debian repositories. According to cinnamon, problem was only in LMDE.<br>
But problems with kde plasma were on all computers and in all systems - debian, lmde, mx, sparky. The main problem with sddm is precisely at startup (if autologin is disabled, which kicksecure launches by default). I also had this problem. It cannot be reproduced when changing user or ending session - only when starting. Sleep mode hung on 3 computers of which there are 5 - on debian and 2 on mx. Solution to problems has always been one - removing security-misc.<br>
This topic is dedicated to other linuxes and is listed on the site as a discussion of kicksecure in other OS. That’s why I shared my experience here. But, once again, debian kde plasma had all same problems. I helped friends to log debian 2 weeks ago, when sddm did not let them in after updating security-misc, They launched console mode and deleted security-misc - problem disappeared. Maybe it is a hardware issue. BUT it was also on old laptops and on new ones from 5 different companies</p> ]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>I have now tested distro morphing Debian 12 Cinnamon into Kicksecure on physical hardware (my main development machine). I used <code>kicksecure-xfce-host</code> this time since it sounded like that’s what you were using. I still can’t reproduce the issue - the install works just fine, security-misc is present, LightDM doesn’t freeze whether I feed it good passwords or bad passwords, sleep works out of the box.</p>
<p>If you and your friend are both running into issues, it’s likely to be the result of one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>What you’re calling Debian is not what I’m calling Debian. I’m using the official Debian 12 (Bookworm) netinstaller, which gives me a vanilla Debian installation. This is what Kicksecure supports, so it’s expected to work. If your “Debian” is Debian 11 (Bullseye) or Debian Testing (Trixie at the time of this writing), that could be the problem.</li>
<li>You and your friend happen to use the same third-party repository on your systems, and that repository is incompatible with Kicksecure in some way.</li>
<li>Both of you are shockingly unlucky when it comes to what hardware you ended up with. (Hardware-specific issues like this are relatively rare nowadays so I wouldn’t expect this to be the case.)</li>
</ul>
<p>I don’t know for sure if any of the above apply here, this is just what comes to mind initially. If there’s any further data you can give about how you’re reproducing this (what software versions you’re using, what steps you’re taking, even hardware info might come in handy), that might help debug this. Currently though I can’t get it to break.</p> ]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>Hmm, I hadn’t thought about this being a Calamares feature request, though I guess that makes sense now that you mention it. I see there’s already an open report that you’ve interacted with at <a href="https://github.com/calamares/calamares/issues/2137" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Allow Calamares to set GRUB password · Issue #2137 · calamares/calamares · GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>Then again, do we <em>want</em> it in Calamares for Kicksecure? We’d be introducing more system state changing bits into the installer, which I know is something we’ve wanted to avoid in the past. It might be better to have a custom tool within the OS that the user can use to set or change the password. Such a tool would be usable in preinstalled VMs as well as newly installed systems.</p>
<p>If we were to use the custom tool solution, I don’t think this is something we could easily upstream somewhere, though it may be worth looking for existing tools that do this. If we want the installer-based solution, then naturally Calamares would be the best place to upstream it.</p> ]]></description>

<p>We should be careful with calling it more secure IMO - the bootloader password may be harder to bypass, but the BIOS password is necessary to complicate attacks that involve booting from an external USB drive. They both have their pros and cons, and ideally should be used together.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also, we should consider how whatever tooling we make for setting this password interacts with FDE. A user with high security requirements might use BIOS password, bootloader password, FDE passphrase, and a user account password, preferably all different. Most users with moderate security requirements will get away with just FDE though, and those with lower requirements can use a BIOS + bootloader password and avoid the overhead and potential data loss risk of FDE. Do we want our tool to tell the user “You’re using FDE, you probably don’t need a bootloader password”? If so, should we make some brief in-tool documentation that explains the threat models each configuration might be used to defend against?</p>

<p>Probably yes.</p>

        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@sam]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>me and my friends used standard morphing installation. i would be grateful if you wrote installation for kde plasma and cinnamon. what commands to enter instead of sudo apt install --no-install-recommends kicksecure-xfce-host. But i also installed separate packages - grub-live, security-misc, tirdad and sdwdate - this also led to login hang. Perhaps there are nuances on the virtual machine, so there are no records of sleep mode and sddm. but i have not yet seen a host system that would not have sddm hang after last security-misc update. in some computers sddm hangs only after an incorrect password. in other computers (and mine) when entering any password. but sleep mode does not hang on my computer and on the computer of one friend, but on two other friends sleep mode always hangs - removing security-misc solved this problem. Even installing only one security-misc package on cde plasma and cinnamon caused freezes. I thought the conflict was only with cde plasma, but recently my friend’s LMDE also froze Lightdm</p>
<p>in old versions of security-misc, these problems were not there. only problem was the wrong password entry in sddm at startup. but sleep mode worked well for everyone. If you install kicksecure xfce morph and remove security-misc, then there are no problems and errors - this has been tested on all the OSes I mentioned</p> ]]></description>

<p>When starting first time to the desktop the Disks application says 24GB used?</p>
<p>This cant be normal. Could some kicksecures memory security features cause this?</p>
<p>Sidenotes:<br>
-Installed tor browser bundle, which has now started suggesting browsing history in address bar after starting tor browser. (Computer was powered on just prior to starting tor browser.) All browsing history settings are off and tor browser default settings should prevent any browsing history carry on from previous instanses. Just mentioning this if it is related to other funnybusiness. Posting this to tor forum also. Search about it gave very little.</p>
<p>-Is it ok to install OpenSnitch on Kicksecure. Would like to see who is calling where. I have been using it as a comforting passifier or excuse, for years for not delving deeper into firewall and ip-taples cringe.</p>
<p>-CD/DVD wont play. VLC player gives error message:</p>
<p>-There was no calculator in applications? Installed Gnome Calculator myself.</p>
<p>Otherwise all is sweet so far.</p>

        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@arraybolt3]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>You’ll have to give more specific steps for how to reproduce this. I’ve just attempted to reproduce the issue using Debian 12 + KDE Plasma, on a UEFI-based virt-manager machine. The exact steps taken are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a new virtual machine, specify that a Debian 12.7.0 netinst ISO should be used</li>
<li>Set RAM to 4 GB, disk space to 20 GB</li>
<li>Check “Customize configuration before installing” on the final screen of the VM creation wizard</li>
<li>Set firmware to UEFI (specifically <code>OVMF_CODE_4M.fd</code>)</li>
<li>Begin installation</li>
<li>Configure as follows:
<ul>
<li>Full Name: <code>User</code></li>
<li>Username: <code>user</code></li>
<li>Disk configuration:
<ul>
<li>Partition 1: EFI System Partition, 300 MB</li>
<li>Partition 2: ext4 mounted at <code>/</code>, use all remaining disk space</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Desktop environment: KDE Plasma</li>
<li>Timezone and locale settings set appropriately</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Once installation is complete, reboot</li>
<li>Carefully follow instructions at <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Debian" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Install Kicksecure inside Debian</a> to morph the distribution into Kicksecure, some notes as to how I followed the instructions:
<ul>
<li>When given the option of using extrepo or manual configuration for initially adding the Kicksecure repository, I chose manual configuration.</li>
<li>Signing key was downloaded using TLS.</li>
<li>“Clearnet Rep.” settings were used for manually configuring the Kicksecure repo.</li>
<li>The Kicksecure metapackage I installed was <code>kicksecure-cli-host</code>, to avoid pulling in XFCE</li>
<li>Before following post-installation steps, I rebooted, tested login via SDDM with both Plasma X11 and Plasma Wayland sessions, confirmed it worked, and confirmed <code>security-misc</code> was installed using <code>dpkg-query -s security-misc</code> (it came back as <code>install ok installed</code>)</li>
<li>In the post-installation steps, I used <code>sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list</code> rather than <code>sudo mv /etc/apt/sources.list ~/</code> for getting rid of the original sources.list file, it contained nothing important</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>With this setup, Kicksecure is installed, <code>security-misc</code> is installed, and SDDM login works just fine, both with Wayland and X11 options. <s>I did not test sleep since this is a virtual machine and getting a virt-manager VM out of sleep can be <em>really hard</em>, but I would expect it to work.</s> EDIT: Just tested sleep too, works without issues, even with <code>security-misc</code> installed.</p>
<p>Some things about your configuration that you may want to double-check that may be the source of some of the issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Did you install <code>kicksecure-cli-host</code> or <code>kicksecure-xfce-host</code>? Doing the latter on a machine with another desktop environment already will end up installing XFCE on the machine, which could conflict with your existing desktop environment in interesting ways.</li>
<li>Is your user account named <code>user</code>? There are some subsystems in Kicksecure that only allow an account named <code>user</code> to take certain actions. It’s possible (though unlikely) that the inability to take those actions with another account could be causing the issue.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ve not yet tested with the Cinnamon desktop, or with Debian derivatives such as Sparky or Mint.</p> ]]></description>

        <title>Harden GRUB bootloader using bootloader password</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@arraybolt3]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>I think I like the idea, especially in combination with disabling “easy” recovery mode and the Dracut recovery console. I think the only thing I’d really like to add to all of the above is that we document how to make the Dracut recovery console available again. I’ve used it for multiple debugging sessions that would have been rendered impossible or close to impossible without it. Let’s go with requiring the password on every boot since that provides substantial benefits over just locking out the configuration options.</p>

<p>GRUB bootloader password to prevent all boot menu entries could be considered more secure than BIOS power-on password, because it’s not a “hardware magic feature” but instead a software feature implemented in Freedom Software, GRUB.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>We should be careful with calling it more secure IMO - the bootloader password may be harder to bypass, but the BIOS password is necessary to complicate attacks that involve booting from an external USB drive. They both have their pros and cons, and ideally should be used together.</p>
<p>Also, we should consider how whatever tooling we make for setting this password interacts with FDE. A user with high security requirements might use BIOS password, bootloader password, FDE passphrase, and a user account password, preferably all different. Most users with moderate security requirements will get away with just FDE though, and those with lower requirements can use a BIOS + bootloader password and avoid the overhead and potential data loss risk of FDE. Do we want our tool to tell the user “You’re using FDE, you probably don’t need a bootloader password”? If so, should we make some brief in-tool documentation that explains the threat models each configuration might be used to defend against?</p> ]]></description>

        <title>Harden GRUB bootloader using bootloader password</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@Patrick]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>There are many different options.</p>
<ul>
<li>F) BIOS power-on password</li>
<li>G) BIOS administrator password</li>
</ul>
<p>These can be different passwords. Administrator password can usually clear/change power-on password and is also allowed to boot.</p>
<p>In this discussion, I was revering to <code>F) BIOS power-on password</code>, a password that is required for every boot.</p>

<p>But in that situation a bootloader password isn’t all that useful, except as defense-in-depth against a relatively unskilled adversary. (Granted, most adversaries most of our users encounter will be relatively unskilled, and I can definitely imagine someone who can figure out a BIOS password reset via an article from the Internet but who can’t figure out how to get past a bootloader password.)</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Right. The the protection provided by the BIOS power-on password isn’t that great. It’s a “hardware magic feature”. Some BIOS can be reset with:</p>
<ul>
<li>recovery code provided by websites, and</li>
<li>removal of CMOS battery,</li>
<li>motherboard BIOS reset jumper.</li>
</ul>
<p>There might be some BIOS resistant to that, designed to not easily being reset, but that is dependent on the hardware producer and may be dependent on the BIOS settings.</p>
