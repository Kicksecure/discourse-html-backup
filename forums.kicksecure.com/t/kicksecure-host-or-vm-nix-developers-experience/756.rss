    <title>Kicksecure - Host or VM. Nix. Developers&#39; experience</title>
    <link>https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/kicksecure-host-or-vm-nix-developers-experience/756</link>
    <description>How do you use Kicksecure yourself? Do you think Kicksecure is the most secure host OS (or the most secure Debian OS?) or do you use it in a VM, with host Fedora, NixOS, Alpine, openSuse, Qubes..? The developers&#39; experience is very important and interesting. After all, you&#39;ve studied many Linux distributions and are creating Kicksecure based on the experience of using other systems. I&#39;m interested in your opinion at the end of 2024. And what do you think about using Nix manager in Kicksecure? What do you think about using distrobox with podman to install packages in Alpine, Fedora or other secure distros?</description>

            <p>My expectation to Kicksecure is to become a good server/desktop distro. But too many things are not working correct.</p>
