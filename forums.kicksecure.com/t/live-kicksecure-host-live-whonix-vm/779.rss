    <description>**Live** **Kicksecure with Live VM**

A live Kicksecure host cannot run a VM.

Is it possible to develop a fully *stateless* system that would function with a live Kicksecure host running a live Whonix VM (set to Immutable in Virtual Box)?

See image of error message here:
-- drive. proton. me /urls/   ATVJSDRBS0#2L5gpa2yNrUJ
-- drive. proton. me /urls/   PMZPCBGZA0#j0B4BZFjRiAx

(FYI, KVM seems the more secure virtualization technology to me since I have seen Oracle’s software crash many times on Fedora hosts. But I understand the Company’s expertise can come in handy from time to time.)



**********

A few additional security observations:

‘**hardened-kernel**’ is a highly appreciated feature in Kicksecure.
wiki/Hardened-kernel
Other software is far more susceptible to kernel crashes. For example, both Qubes (Fedora Dom0) and Graphene OS have observable soft-spots in their kernel and it would be very unfortunate if one stored a wallet with Amethyst, etc (Android) or in a weak Fedora host. Building Mobian on Pine64 towards a mobile Kicksecure spin would be awesome for secure mobile crypto wallets that could interact with POS IRL

+ virtualization not strong - i.e. rpc and qrexec really all connected

**Native sandboxing**  like Firejail is also a good place to direct one’s efforts in developing Kicksecure. https:/  /www.  kicksecure. com/wiki/Sandbox-app-launcher
After extensive testing, it would appear that the MAC control and permission hardening paradigm of TAILS is stronger than the compartmentalization and isolation through virtualization strategy of Qubes OS.

**Dual Strength Tor Level** options – If one takes a look at Nym (Chaum mixnet - Free Haven whitepapers) VPN, you can see that there is a Wireguard level and a mixnet level for secure messaging and confidential layer blockchain. I would recommend something similar if not handled on an app-by-app basis for levels of tor: *one layer with Vanguards* and another *layer for low-latency* tor.

**Kloak** - keystroke anonymization is also a very interesting Kicksecure feature under development that is not offered in any other major distribution.</description>

            <p><strong>Hard Code</strong><br>
Stateless (think live) and memory safe (e.g. Rust lang) computing are a hard problem in CS.</p>
<p>For example:<br>
Q: Why can’t you run a VPN live?<br>
Q: Why can’t you run a virtual machine on a live host but you can have a live VM?<br>
Q: Why not ‘live’ (memory safe as possible) wallets? A ‘live’ VM with a Electrum or other crypto currency wallet would be more secure (less susceptible to malicious code modifications not intended by the user) but you have to actually do something more like TAILS <em>persistence</em> for this to work.</p>

<p><strong>Latency</strong><br>
Try working with Nym mixnet. Read the Chaum white paper on Free Haven. Observe how tor + Vanguards (github Mike Perry) functions. Try using tor browser on the “safest” setting. There are many trade-offs that have to be considered when utilizing the internet skillfully. There is not just one answer for everthing as if you could onionsite all your activity online with TB.</p>
<p>I am very interested in Kicksecure as a strong and trusted host for utilizing Nym mixnet network for Zcash and Vanguards with tor network for Monero in Electrum Wallet. Is TAILS or Whonix a more secure OS for the Electrum Wallet?</p>

<p>True, Proton does seem hostile to truly anonymous networking. The slides of screenshots from drive are just to illustrate the point. No need to link if you are mistrustful.</p>

<p>Yeah it is underrated. One thing I think would be great to improve on was screen keyboard integration to the xfce panel. However I don’t like <code>onboard</code> compared to screen keyboard that GNOME uses with accessibility settings. Not sure of the package name or if its a dependency that is apart of wider ranged GNOME package?</p>

<p>I didn’t think there was such a thing as <em>low-latency</em> tor since UDP is not supported. When you mean <em>low-latency</em>, what types of applications are you talking about cuz even with VPN and things like I2P some applications like real-time communication are not optimized imho.</p>
