    <title>Sdwdate wont connect, cant update and upgrade, but the tor browser works?</title>

    <description>Sdwdate wont connect. I cant update and upgrade Kicksecure either. 
Tor browser works fine though.
Sdwdate started doing this recently. 
Yesterday sdwdate just finally worked for some reason. 
Today I have restarted it every 5-10 minutes for the last 2 hours in hope of resurrecting it. 

Update/upgrade command times out while waiting response from proxys.
Synaptic Package Manager wont connect either.
also System Check program cant connect to Tor for Tor Bootstrap test.

So why browser connects, but rest of the toys wont?</description>

            <p>Because the Tor Browser Bundle starts its own internal Tor and does not use system Tor. These two different Tor processes run independently. This is as per TBB upstream (The Tor Project) (original developer) default configuration.</p>
