    <description>**Proposal for** **Exclusive Authentication Token**:

system multifactor auth and killswitch in one user-tethered dongle

Secure boot can be implemented in Kicksecure for platform binding, but what about other hardware-engaging options like locking LUKS with a security key?

* search: support nitrokey com – Unlocking LUKS with a USB key on Fedora/Qubes
* search: Fedora forum - which dracut method (Yubikey)

* What does the Kicksecure team think about measured boot (HEADS BIOS) and Anti-Evil Maid (see AEM - Qubes OS + TPM)?

*BusKill* by Michael Altfield (on github) utilizes an app that triggers a hotplug removal event (in libusb) and a specific drive and port can be designated (usb: 00x , 00x) so that other USB devices do not trigger the shutdown.

Therefore, **a single usb device could both** authenticate LUKS cryptab with FIDO (biometric and/or unique physical token) and trigger a hotplug removal event in libusb on the BusKill application (python, sha256, .btz).

Would Kicksecure approve of this feature or can anyone on the development team find any security flaw with this technique being implemented?

In TAILS OS, all one has to do is attach a lanyard to the TAILS USB device and wrap the cord around your wrist. If the computer is forcefully removed from you, both the shutdown sequence is initiated and the RAM is cleared and persistent storage is again locked in the FDE state. However, if developer mode is and security-misc is fully enabled on Kicksecure, one has to wait for sudo shutdown and if unencumbered on the stable or testing mode, the computer could be stolen while in an unlocked state.</description>
