    <title>NetworkManager not routing based on ProxyAutoConfiguration&#39;s script</title>

    <description># Description
(**KickSecure** / **Whonix**) are both solid choices when it comes to (privacy &amp; security) for a system with low (specs. CPU, RandomAccessMemory &amp; Storage). While **Whonix-Host** is still under heavy development and not available yet to the public, &#39;sitting&#39; with **KS** is the best course of action to be taken.

To experiment, I&#39;ve decided to *route specific site to **TheOnionRouter** via PAC&#39;s script on NetworkManager* which it doesn&#39;t seems to route correctly. Extensive research had been carried out by me and *no (resolution, resources) regarding the issue have been found* as of writing.

Assistance on the issue can mean a lot to me on my journey to learn more technology based knowledge.
Thank You</description>
