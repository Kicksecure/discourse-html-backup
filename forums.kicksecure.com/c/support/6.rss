            <p>Followed wiki and setup kicksecure correctly, on the last leg to install whonix I followed the only command per the wiki (kicksecure/wiki/Whonix) being: whonix-xfce-installer-cli</p>
<p>I get this error:<br>
whonix-xfce-installer-cli: [ERROR]: Installer exited with code: ‘1’<br>
zsh: exit 1     whonix-xfce-installer-cli</p>
<p>Any Help would be appreciated.</p>

            <p>So the way I installed Kicksecure was without granting root rights to user to lock it down better.<br>
How can I make it so user can still do upgrade-nonroot without adding user to the sudo group?</p>
<p>Would changing the permissions to the <code>upgrade-nonroot</code> and <code>apt-get-update-plus</code> achieve this?</p>
<p><code>chmod 755 /usr/bin/upgrade-nonroot</code></p>
<p><code>chmod 755 /usr/bin/apt-get-update-plus</code></p>
<p>Would this be a stupid idea? (just want to be able to use user to update/upgrade not install packages)</p>

I want to create a separate Kicksecure secure hardened and no-login user(like <code>www-data</code> for Apache) to run Containers(podman, Docker or LXC), Proxmox or any other software.<br>
The <code>user</code> already have too much privileges and I want to avoid from using it.<br>

<p>Could something like <code>dbus-uuidgen --ensure=/etc/machine-id</code> or <code>systemd-machine-id-setup</code> be used on startup to create new machine each boot without issue?</p>

            <p>Trying to apply kicksecure’s hardenings to Parrot Home edition (Vbox), but i ran into some problems. Here is the output:<br>
sudo apt install --no-install-recommends kicksecure-cli-vm<br>
Reading package lists… Done<br>
Building dependency tree… Done<br>
Reading state information… Done<br>
Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have<br>
requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable<br>
distribution that some required packages have not yet been created<br>
or been moved out of Incoming.<br>
The following information may help to resolve the situation:</p>
<p>The following packages have unmet dependencies:<br>
kicksecure-recommended-cli : Depends: libblockdev-crypto2 but it is not installable<br>
plymouth : Conflicts: console-common but 0.7.91 is to be installed<br>
: Error, pkgProblemResolver::Resolve generated breaks, this may be caused by held packages.</p>
<p>Already tried and searched for many solutions, but none of them really solved my problem. Someone can help me?</p>

<p>connection timeout when trying to mount from the command line.</p>
<p>I have double shecked hosts.allow and exports on the server, but they didnt seem to have been altered by installing kicksecure.</p>
<p>I DO have multiple NIC installed (4). 2 in use to WAN via router1, and 1 in use to router2 (local LAN)</p>
<p>portlist shows tcp 2049<br>
rpcinfo shows<br>
portmapper ports 111 TCP &amp; UDP for versions 2,3,4<br>
nfs ports 2049 TCP versions 3 &amp; 4, and a nfs_acl on 2049 for version 3</p>
<p>ideally i would prefer to have an IP or MAC verified w/o kerberos, but I will take what I can at the moment I cant get mount working…</p>
