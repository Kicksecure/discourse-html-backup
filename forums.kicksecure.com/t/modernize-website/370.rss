    <title>Modernize Website</title>
    <link>https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/modernize-website/370</link>
    <description>Current state of the website is not the best. It looks obsolete. Images are pixelated in most instances. And even if they were not pixelated, they would still be archaic, because they are basically windows xp era icons.

Second problem: website is badly structured. Too many unnecessary pieces if you ask me. Also the website does not make the organization clear.

Also the name kicksecure is just too long. And also, having a .com domain makes the wrong impression.

Suggestion:

* Modernize images
* Too many images also tbh, you don&#39;t need to declare thunderbird and vlc are default on the homepage. Also the thunderbird logo is more than a year old. Anyway
* Modernize logo (simplify)
* Consider using kicksec instead of kicksecure
* Write a manifesto where you declare the principles (can draft one if you like)
* Write policies and stuff clearly
* Lay down a structure. What is kicksecure? I don&#39;t know some random set of repos and a website. Make it more organized and organizaiton like. Make it possible to become members. Levels of memebership I don&#39;t know something. Make the impression that you are organized (and also be organized).
* Consider posting regular blogs or whatever, keep in touch with the peasants
* Where is the sauce? What if I have a pull for the website? Consider making it public or making it easier to find out
* Have a voting and proposal mechanisms based on members
* Declare principles and whatnot like other free software projects (clearly)

What is kicksecure? If the answer is something other than &quot;whonix without tor&quot;, than the website gives the wrong impression. 450 links and sections for virtualbox and kvm and stuff. Wow, is this a virtual only os? Well I guess, no one ever has this kind of stuff on the front page.

So I suggest: No vm stuff ever. One link and one download to rule them all, a live installation image. For this another post is coming.</description>

<p>I butchered many old images in the past by mistake. Was using MAT2 to<br>
remove Metadata not because it matters but as part of size optimization<br>
which reduces load time and traffic. Didn‚Äôt notice that it lossy<br>
conversion instead of lossless.</p>
<p>Since the images folder on the server is git version controlled, many<br>
images are still available in their original unprocessed version. One<br>
day I might get to manage a script to restore them from git and then<br>
re-apply lossless optimizations.</p>

<p>Renaming would be a huge effort. So it would need to be super worthwhile<br>
for this change to be worthwhile.</p>
<p>There‚Äôs a number of criteria / checklist (which I don‚Äôt remember where<br>
documented, notes) for project name selection. So if needed, would need<br>
to be re-invented. Among these:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not easily auto completed to unrealted search results.</li>
<li>Globally unique (or almost unique at least), not yet found in search<br>
results of major search engines, video platforms.</li>
<li>Domain names with the same name and social media accounts (mostly)<br>
available.</li>
</ul>

<p>And also, having a .com domain makes the wrong impression.</p>

<p>.com is the most popular domain. Biggest websites are mostly .com. It‚Äôs<br>

<blockquote>
<p>Make it possible to become members. Levels of memebership I don‚Äôt<br>
know something.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don‚Äôt know either. Dunno what that would entail. Best discussed in<br>
separate forum thread.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs quite a task to invent such a system. What the requirements are<br>
to become a member, etc. One would need to compare how others where this<br>
(somewhat) works is done such as in Debian.</p>
<p>The membership, free, paid or both. Privileges and responsibilities. In<br>
Debian, becoming a Debian Developer is free of any membership charge but<br>
requires a lot contributions to Debian, a proposer to be eligible.<br>
Privileges includes the ability to upload packages for which they are<br>
maintainer or NMU (non-maintainer upload) any other packages, subject to<br>
the rules in the Debian policy.</p>
<p>It would be a gigantic effort to study, understand, fork Debian‚Äôs<br>
structure. That includes Debian constitution, DSFG, Debian policy and<br>
probably much more.</p>
<p>Doesn‚Äôt necessarily need to be Debian but seems a good starting point as<br>
Debian survived for decades and I am already knowledgeable about a lot<br>
bits and pieces of above mentioned.</p>
<p>Not useful to say ‚Äúdo it like OpenSUSE‚Äù or ‚Äúdo it like RedHat‚Äù as these<br>
have sponsors and/or investors / capital / full-time employees and<br>
whatnot. That‚Äôs not easily replicated. Something like Debian or Arch<br>
Linux easier to replicate as these are apparently community projects<br>
based on volunteers.</p>
<p>Instead I finally wrote up an alternative idea:</p>

<p>Proposals (usually called feature requests) are frequently arriving.</p>

<p>In Debian votes are more useful as it involves decisions on things which<br>
are very realistic to implement where Debian Developers are already<br>
