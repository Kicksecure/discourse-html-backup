But current issue is that the newly installed packages for already kicksecure users will receive an upgrade with the new packages + recommended packages (not with --no-recommends as kicksecure installed) meaning it might pull unwanted extra packages like avahi or samba or..etc

Current example is [VLC](https://packages.debian.org/bullseye/vlc) which is installed with its recommended package (not depends) [`vlc-plugin-samba`](https://packages.debian.org/bullseye/vlc-plugin-samba) which install samba and smbclient libraries as a result (even if they are safe still considered extra for kicksecure installation). 

good thing its removable without extra issues:

Either something by kicksecure can be done forcing packages to not pull recommends if added newly or by the end user with apt. 

Note: This is only effecting newly added packages with previous kicksecure users, new kicksecure users will install kicksecure with --no-install-recommends as mentioned in the wiki.</description>

    This post for: 

Removing Unnecessary packages (specially if they are not default in upstream and/or has issues like stopped development, less secure or producing too many issues).
Adding necessary packages for better security or usability (as long as they are not harmful).


Removing packages: 

Remove wget since its not upstream default and less secure than curl (kicksecure support scurl), OR replace it with the successor wget2.

Can been seen added as extra package for debian stable:
