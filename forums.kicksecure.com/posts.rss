        <title>Whonix packages to install on Kicksecure for anonymized hostname, machine id and timezone</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@frorum]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>Hi,</p>
<p>If Whonix is an extension of Tor Browser, I want Kicksecure as an extension of Mullvad Browser.</p>
<p>I don’t need Tor networking, but I would like to hide my timezone and hostname, etc. Are there simple packages from Whonix that can be installed to hide it in Kicksecure?</p>
<p>Is it ‘anon-ws-base-files’?</p> ]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>I think <a class="mention" href="https://forums.kicksecure.com/u/patrick">@Patrick</a> have a definition. *his definition</p>
<p>I just think the operating system is developing too fast, and lack a little grounding in the process. KS &amp; W are one operating system, not two (efficiency-wise).</p>
<p>KS = base (earth), W = extension (building).<br>
Without a strong and stable ‘earth’ / ‘ground’, how’s the ‘building’ even gonna hold up.</p>
<p>base = core<br>
extension = blending</p>
<p>We can have some sort of module to enable the ‘extension’. Take a look at slax(dot).org. Let’s build something similiar.</p>
<p>I’m typing kind of randomly because I’m flooded with idea that can draw more attention. Whonix is publically know to be better than Tails (most of the time). Tails and Whonix are well known. Whonix is second to QubesOS(the extreme). It is considered lighter in resource usage. Low End Computer can still take advantage of KickSecure.</p>
<p>Bear with me, Please plot mindmap and you’ll understand what I want to present.</p>
<p>Suggestion</p>
<ol>
<li>module based (features can be loaded and unloaded) (this can help to target people with specific requirement, strictest or not)</li>
<li>securityManager (all security related settings are only in here, so we don’t need package separation)</li>
<li>light on resources</li>
<li>To make the operating system beautiful, hire archcraft owner to do the beautifying job</li>
<li>Documenting can be hard, switch to arch based one day. Because every live mode will boot into a fresh state. We can take advantage of documented resources.</li>
<li>Make the operating system light enough to support copy2ram</li>
<li>Strip out bluetooth, audio by default. Can be reloaded via module.</li>
<li>Ship with Firefox ESR with strictest privacy options enable. No Extension Yet of course. It’s not hardening like arkenfox thing, but default settings after pulled to the max security.</li>
<li>coming soon.</li>
</ol>
<p>is heavy operating system really required to ensure security ? is what i’m really curious about. Not saying Whonix or KickSecure is heavy but hey it’s an improvement and the code base will be easy to manage, small &amp; efficient. Isn’t that what we want ? We’re the technology itself.</p> ]]></description>

        <title>Faillock: Error reading tally directory: No such file or directory</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@doremifasola]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>Woke up one morning with the laptop on my chest. To get Tor rocking I tried to set manually sdwdate clock like I always do, because the CMOS battery is done or something else is off since replacing the battery didint make any difference.</p>
<p>Anyway got <strong>ERROR: Login blocked after 50 attempts</strong>. Followed unlocking instructions from Unlock User Account: Excessive Wrong Password Entry Attempts on Safely Use Root Commands page.</p>
<p>Booted in to a recovery mode in GRUB/BIOS advanced options for … something.<br>
Run the      <strong>faillock --user user --reset</strong>     in the maintenance state/mode.<br>
Went back to regular kicksecure and sudo/login pw was still locked.<br>
Tried several times back and forth with no avail.<br>
Also tried only <strong>faillock</strong> command which should show list of login attempts.<br>
It told me:  <strong>faillock: Error reading tally directory: No such file or directory</strong><br>
Tried  <strong>which faillock</strong>  it told me the path to faillock, so it seems to be existing anyway.</p>
<p>To clarify I can get to desktop by turning on laptop since there is only encryption password prompt, but cant do anything sudo and if I let it idle too long the login prompt comes up and I have to reboot to get back, though I could maybe remove hibernation or whatever it is that triggers login prompt.</p>
<p>Printed all that internets had about it. Havent tried other stuff yet. Many point towards creating/touching such a directory. Dont know if I should follow strangers advice to touch hidden places. What could go wrong?</p>
<p>Still wondering how it got locked. Is it even possible to fall a sleep with hands on keyboard on such a position that the user login prompt gets saturated? Will it accept continous enter as a attempt?</p> ]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>If the OS has malware that is running as root / administrator / SYSTEM / some other highly privileged user account depending on the particular OS you’re working with, then yes. Read-only flags are enforced in software only, and anything with high privileges on a system can turn off or even just ignore those flags. So if you’re going to do this, you should only share the drive between systems you trust to not have malware on them.</p> ]]></description>

<p>(<strong>KickSecure</strong> / <strong>Whonix</strong>) are both solid choices when it comes to (privacy &amp; security) for a system with low (specs. CPU, RandomAccessMemory &amp; Storage). While <strong>Whonix-Host</strong> is still under heavy development and not available yet to the public, ‘sitting’ with <strong>KS</strong> is the best course of action to be taken.</p>
<p>To experiment, I’ve decided to <em>route specific site to <strong>TheOnionRouter</strong> via PAC’s script on NetworkManager</em> which it doesn’t seems to route correctly. Extensive research had been carried out by me and <em>no (resolution, resources) regarding the issue have been found</em> as of writing.</p>

        <title>Apparmor.service failed at boot</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@jnd]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>Hello everyone,<br>
I’ve come to ask for your help again.<br>
I have been testing the Hunchly application for a few days. I was using their appimage and extension on Brave. At the end of the trial period I decided to delete the application and the extension.<br>
Since then, I’ve been getting a boot error: apparmor.service won’t start.</p>
<p>Here are the log messages regarding the boot error and the inability to start the service manually. The problem is clearly related to the presence of a hunchly profile in apparmor.d. But there’s no mention of this in the documentation.</p>
<p>How can I solve this problem? Thanks in advance for your solution.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>Thank you for answering <a class="mention" href="https://forums.kicksecure.com/u/arraybolt3">@arraybolt3</a>. Do you think 32GB of RAM (which is the highest, standard amount of 16x2) would be sufficient? Then a custom and expensive amount of RAM would not be necessary and running both guest and host live is a reasonable possibility.</p>
<p>At one time Qubes OS offered an ‘alpha’ live USB iso. I sought out a new ‘developer’ OS after my Qubes system was destroyed by an attacker (ROP sigkill VM-s, qubesd and d-bus – I shared drive links to screenshots of these events if anyone is curious). Perhaps an expert looking at the slides (that is another good use for sandboxing if mistrustful) would be able to tell what sort of vulnerability caused the crashes. At the time, I was also experiencing frequent kernel crashes on Graphene OS. As you noted, adding Kloak to TAILS is possible, but that might not be optimal even though additional software can be added. TAILS is an OS that seeks to appear uniform (everyone looks like tor Windows) and is not a ‘development’ OS for testing and building new projects.</p>
<p>If <strong>harden-kernel</strong> is not maintained well enough for mainstream use, is that also true of <strong>hide-hardware-info</strong> (abstraction with virtualization does this to a certain extent as does mandatory access control)? These are still interesting development areas even if more work is needed.</p>
<p>It is probably wise to onionize deb.whonix (for Kloak) and deb.kicksecure in derivative.list for best security. Or do you think https is sufficient? <strong>Onion-tls</strong> <strong>repositories</strong> are also under development. Do you have any thoughts about building secure signing enclaves like Arch or do you think apt is still the best way to update and acquire packages? I read the discussion about getting a tarball vs. the service unit for Kloak. There is no way to ‘update’ an .ova or a .libvirt; it is transferred (“transmitted”) like a tar file is “down” loaded.

Calamares cu<span class="show-more-container"><a href="" rel="noopener" class="show-more">…</a></span><span class="excerpt hidden">rrently has a setting `installEFIFallback` in `/etc/calamares/modules/bootloader.conf`. This feature is supposed to install a copy of the OS bootloader to the removable media path (e.g., `/boot/efi/EFI/BOOT`), allowing the installation to be booted even if the UEFI BIOS isn't able to find the OS-specific bootloader.

While dynamite in theory, the implementation is a bit too simple to work reliably on all distros. Right now all it does (simplifying away arch-specific considerations) is finds the `grubx64.efi` file from the normal bootloader location for the OS, and copies it to `bootx64.efi` in the removable media path. While I guess this could work on some distros, this doesn't work at all on Debian (and by extension Kicksecure) for at least two reasons:

* Debian's GRUB requires a stub `grub.cfg` file to be shipped alongside the GRUB EFI executable itself. This stub config tells GRUB how to find the real `grub.cfg`. Without this stub config file, the bootloader simply drops you to a GRUB shell.
* `grubx64.efi` can't be booted directly with Secure Boot in 99.9% of circumstances. You have to boot `shimx64.efi`. The shim then boots `grubx64.efi` which in turn boots the kernel and initramfs. If you copy `grubx64.efi` to the removable media path on a Secure Boot system, it is unusable because Secure Boot will reject it.

Under Debian, the proper way to install GRUB to the fallback bootloader location is:

```
sudo debconf-set-selections &lt;&lt;&lt; "grub-efi-amd64 grub2/force_efi_extra_removable boolean true"
sudo dpkg-reconfigure --default-priority grub-efi-amd64
```

In essence, this sets a configuration variable in debconf that tells Debian "any time you're reinstalling GRUB, make sure to install it to both the normal *and* fallback bootloader locations." Then it tells Debian to reconfigure the grub-efi-amd64 package, thus resulting in GRUB being reinstalled to both the normal and fallback locations as requested.

Obviously, this won't work on anything other than Debian and *some* of its derivatives (notably, this can't be used on Ubuntu because Ubuntu's GRUB package doesn't have the `grub2/force_efi_extra_removable` debconf setting), but for Debian and suitably similar derivatives, it would be far preferable to the current way of installing the fallback bootloader.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
It would be really awesome if Calamares' fallback bootloader installation code could look at the OS its running on, and use an OS-specific routine for installing the fallback bootloader if that particular OS is supported. If that OS is not supported by a special routine, fallback to the existing way of installing the bootloader, potentially echoing a warning to the log. (The warning might be a step too far, not sure.)

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
We could do this using shellprocesses instead, but that seems wrong. Calamares offers a feature for installing the bootloader to the fallback location, so I don't think it's unreasonable to make that feature do what it says on the tin more reliably.

**Additional context**
Multiple Kicksecure users are trying to install Kicksecure onto USB drives (as in, doing full installations of Kicksecure to a USB like they'd do to a hard drive). This setup is particularly vulnerable to ending up with the normal bootloader becoming unusable, since such a portable installation may be booted on multiple computers, or the computer it is intended for use on might be booted with the USB drive removed in some instances. One way or another, users end up having to rely on the fallback bootloader, and the fallback bootloader is currently totally unusable.

 installed.
 ```
 
grub-pc, on the other hand, is installed by default, which means that the BIOS bootloader will be updated properly. Sadly grub-pc and grub-efi-amd64 can't be installed at the same time, so you can't have both bootloaders be continuously updated. Of the two, I'd argue the UEFI bootloader is the more important one to keep continuously up-to-date, because it's the one that has Secure Boot implications, while grub-pc doesn't.

Furthermore, while grml-debootstrap installs the bootloader to the removable media location by default using the `--removable` switch, the `grub2/force_efi_extra_removable` debconf variable isn't being set. This means that even if `grub-efi-amd64` is installed, the fallback bootloader won't be updated when GRUB updates, potentially leaving security issues.

(Note: This isn't an issue that can be solved entirely in grml-debootstrap. In my testing, even installing `grub-efi-amd64` and setting the debconf variable correctly wasn't working to get UEFI bootloader updates to work on an image built with grml-debootstrap. I don't understand why, but suspect it may be a bug in Debian's `grub-efi-amd64.postinst` script.)</span></p>

        <title>Live Kicksecure Host, Live Whonix VM</title>

<blockquote>
<p>A live Kicksecure host cannot run a VM.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The main challenge here is that while live mode keeps the root filesystem read-only, the OS itself needs to be able to write to the root filesystem. This paradox means we have to use an overlayfs in RAM, which keeps all changes to the root filesystem in RAM. This means that while booted in live mode, your available disk space is limited by available system RAM. VMs used during this time have to run <em>entirely</em> in RAM, which is hard when your VM disks are even modestly large. When you modify a file when using OverlayFS, the base file is copied wholesale into the overlayed filesystem, meaning if you boot a Whonix VM while in live mode, the whole disk image has to be loaded into RAM, which is difficult unless you have <em>a lot</em> of RAM. For this reason, it will probably be impractical to run a Whonix VM while booted into Kicksecure’s live mode. Instead, you can boot Kicksecure into persistent mode, and then boot the Whonix VMs themselves in live mode.</p>
<p>What may be possible in the future (no promises, I’ve only talked about this idea briefly with <a class="mention" href="https://forums.kicksecure.com/u/patrick">@Patrick</a> and it may not be on the roadmap at all) is that Kicksecure could potentially boot <em>itself</em> in a VM while in live mode. Essentially when the root filesystem is immutable, you can actually boot it multiple times (once on the host and then once per VM you run) without running into any conflicts, so long as each user of the base filesystem uses their own overlay and doesn’t touch the contents of the base disk. This would let you have the protection offered by a VM, without requiring any extra disk space. This wouldn’t give you the advantages of Whonix (at least not the way I have it envisioned), but it would give you sandboxing. This will potentially become easy to implement if Kicksecure gets support for <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Verified_Boot" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Verified Boot</a>.</p>

        <title>Live Kicksecure Host, Live Whonix VM</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@KSWhonixXMR]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p><strong>Observations on Kloak</strong></p>
<p>Of course, typing off-line is the best way to prevent site-side keystroke fingerprinting but that behavior is inconvinent if one is always copy pasting to search bars and not just to paragraph or multi-sentence texteras (postings). But Kloak also anonymizes peripheral inputs which cannot be taken off-line like mouse<br>
and scrolls.</p>
<p>When installed on the host, you can immediately detect that the sensitivity of the inputs has changed.</p>
<p>Since there is no bare-metal Whonix, I presume that the fact that Kloak is alrealy installed means that some action is taking place, although it is not sensorily evident.</p>
<p>The test from vmonaco(dot)com/device-fingerprinting was very interesting. You can see that ‘N=’ changes between enabling or disabling kloak via <code>systemctl</code>.</p>
<p>Since I interepret <span class="mention">@quicksilver</span> as referring to touch screens on mobile devices, I will also add that the UBlock Origin add-on functions in a similar way when testing with vmonaco and this can be added to mobile browsers. No doubt, Kloak is much more advanced.</p>
<p>Seeing Kloak in action was very exciting. Kloak is not available in Qubes OS (Fedora bare-metal) or TAILS but site-side deanonymization via type fingerprinting analysis much be a major source of identifying information in cyberspace.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="mention" href="https://forums.kicksecure.com/u/privacy">@privacy</a> - dvm (live/disposible VMs) in Qubes with any VPN service does not function. In a sense, tor is just a particular kind of VPN and it does function live. Mullvad does not function live in any way. I have tried it. Please prove what you claim is true with a screenshot or a substantiate with a link. You are trolling, it could be claimed. What is ESL? It is not possible to run a guest VM with a live host. That is not trolling. You have some prejudice about substanitating or citing information.</p>
<p>Aparently, people only use Linux for onionsites or bitcoin or have one device for every other aspect of the interenet that doesn’t function with tor and the highest levels of anonymity and another device for projects similar to Whonix. Another possibility is that everyone in the tor community is wating for the day when everything is onionsprayed and accessible via tor and not blocked by corporate capitalism that wants everything tracked and blocks tor.</p> ]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>OK, I think I get it a bit more - Ubuntu seems to default to installing the GRUB bootloader to the fallback bootloader path, while Debian’s bootloader config defaults to <em>not</em> installing it in that fashion.

        <title>Secure Boot - invalid signature</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@arraybolt3]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>So I’ve now tested this quite a bit, and I believe the root issue here is that Calamares is just not installing the fallback bootloader correctly for Debian-based systems on Secure Boot enabled devices. The way Calamares handles installing the fallback bootloader is to simply copy grubx64.efi from the Kicksecure-specific bootloader to the fallback bootloader location. This doesn’t work - Debian (and therefore Kicksecure) need it to be copying shimx64.efi, fbx64.efi, and mmx64.efi to the fallback bootloader location, renaming shimx64.efi to bootx64.efi in the process.</p>
<p>Debian Testing has the <em>exact</em> same problem as Kicksecure in this regard it appears. Somehow this actually works on Ubuntu, but not on Debian, and I do not know why yet.</p> ]]></description>

Q: Why can’t you run a VPN live?<br>

Q: Why not ‘live’ (memory safe as possible) wallets? A ‘live’ VM with a Electrum or other crypto currency wallet would be more secure (less susceptible to malicious code modifications not intended by the user) but you have to actually do something more like TAILS <em>persistence</em> for this to work.</p>
