    <title>Propose building off Alpine Linux</title>
    <link>http://forums.kicksecure.com/t/propose-building-off-alpine-linux/107</link>
    <description>Hello, I was reading the Whonix.org page where it details pros/cons of building off different operating systems, but the Alpine Linux section seems to be from 2015. I think Kicksecure&#39;s goal of providing a secure OS by default would work really well off Alpine Linux, particularly considering the progress Alpine has made in the past few years. The list on the dev site says that an OS for Whonix needs:

- Acceptable usability (they have functional builds off the latest gnome and kde desktops as described [here](https://9to5linux.com/alpine-linux-3-16-improves-nvme-support-adds-gnome-42-and-kde-plasma-5-24-lts) as well as their own wiki)
- Must be somewhat popular (they are rated #30 on distrowatch, and their use has grown in recent years as they moved from mostly servers to default on many Docker builds. Recently they have also become more popular after being one of the main OS options for pinephones via pmOS and expanding to desktops. They have been featured on lists describing the best Linux distros for privacy-focused users, see [here](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-linux-distros-for-privacy-security/) for an example)
- No legal/trademark issues (good)
- Must have a secure package manager (I won&#39;t pretend to be an expert on this or the next few points, but it&#39;s worth checking)

Alpine Linux is fast, slim, and dedicated to security (detailed [here](https://alpinelinux.org/about) and in more detail [here](https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Alpine_Linux:Overview)). It seems that basing Kicksecure off Alpine Linux would be much smaller and simpler than using Debian, which is huge and does not place a priority on security. For these reasons I believe it would be worth considering using Alpine Linux instead of Debian. Thanks for your time</description>

            <p>Hello, thanks for your patience. I went ahead and filled out the things on the wiki that I could find on Alpine’s wiki and their organization’s site. I also included references for more information. I hope this helps,<br>

  <p>this post details number of glaring security holes in Whonix and it’s current design, while most of Linux desktop is affected by this, the risks can be greatly reduced, massive performance gains and easier to audit  I am willing to develop a “testing...</p>

<p>No need to be an expert. Easy and actionable is raising the topic upstream and at TUF as per:</p>
