    <title>What are the Biggest Do&#39;s and Don&#39;ts of Kicksecure</title>
    <link>https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/what-are-the-biggest-dos-and-donts-of-kicksecure/232</link>
    <description>When piloting this thing, I wanted to know what are the biggest do&#39;s and don&#39;ts of this software. 

Secondly, I&#39;d like a clarification: is the CLI version more secure than the XFCE version? How and why?

Lastly, does the team have any plans for opt-in telemetry? I seek this feature because I am not very technically oriented enough to file bug report. I am learning, but I think automatic bug reports would also be good too.

Do you support recurring donations?</description>
