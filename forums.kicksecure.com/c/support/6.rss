            <p>Apologies, I accidentally posted on Whonix Forums.</p>
<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I’m trying to get Wayland working with Kicksecure/KVM.</p>
<p>Installing a Wayland compositor like sway or labwc in XFCE Kicksecure is not an option, due to the qemu bug which rotates the cursor by 180 degress. This happens with any DE that doesn’t fully integrate Wayland. (sway issue <span class="hashtag-raw">#6581</span> on git)</p>
<p>Using Kicksecure with LXQT or KDE which have native Wayland support fixes that issue. (already tested with CLI Version)</p>
<p>Can I simply replace or add a few packages in Derivative-Maker to achieve this?</p>
<p>Looks like <code>derivative-maker/packages/kicksecure/kicksecure-meta-packages/debian/control</code>, lists the following meta-packages and their dependencies (containing all xfce packages) which could be changed to install LXQT instead of XFCE:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">kicksecure-xfce
kicksecure-desktop-applications-xfce
kicksecure-desktop-environment-essential-xfce
kicksecure-shared-host-xfce
.......etc
</code></pre>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">xfce4 &gt; lxqt
mousepad &gt; featherpad
xfce4-terminal &gt; qterminal
....etc
</code></pre>
<p>After some more digging the variable <code>dist_build_script_build_dependency</code> in <code>build-steps.d/1200_prepare-build-machine</code> contains all the packages listed in <code>kicksecure-meta-packages/debian/control</code>.</p>
<p>I keep seeing <code>"$@"</code> in  <code>3500_install-packages</code> later on, so I’m assuming some of the packages are passed as an argument to the install functions.</p>
<p>My plan would be to either switch the xfce packages to lxqt in <code>/kicksecure/kicksecure-meta-packages/debian/control</code> or if that’s no good then sed replace them in the variable that holds all install dependencies.</p>
<p>Finally, config stuff seems to be handled by <code>derivative-maker/packages/kicksecure/desktop-config-dist</code>. There I’d just replace <code>/etc/skel/.config</code> xmls with lxqt ones.</p>
<p>Is that pretty much it or am I missing something?</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>

          <title>Virtualbox/KVM for Kicksecure Live</title>

            <p>Virtualbox/KVM for Kicksecure Live</p>
<p>We should consider adding Virtualbox to Kicksecure by default, maybe only for Kicksecure Live USB at least (virtualbox is there before installation, but not after, to reduce attack surface). This will make possible to run any virtual machines from a plausibly-deniable external drive without leaving a trace on the computer. This also helps to reduce attack surface for the host os (kicksecure live usb), as it is amnesic and it is harder for malware to persist, especially with physical write-protection switch enabled.</p>
<p>Kicksecure Live USB → Virtualbox/KVM → Whonix VM/other OS.</p>
<p>Something like this could be done if Kicksecure was installed on the usb drive and the virtualbox installed on it manually, and after that user must be careful to launch live-mode only every time. But this is not as plausibly-deniable as a plain Kicksecure installation media, and it is obvious that Virtualbox was installed there for a reason. If every Kicksecure installation out there contained Virtualbox by default, it would be impossible for an attacker to claim that someone installed virtualisation software for a purpose of hiding something.</p>
<p>Essentially I am talking about something like HiddenVM mod for TAILS but with proper hardened nature of Kicksecure.</p>
<p>If that is not possible, at least we should consider creating a wiki-guide with information on how to add Virtualbox in Kicksecure Live Installation USB manually.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>If Whonix is an extension of Tor Browser, I want Kicksecure as an extension of Mullvad Browser.</p>
<p>I don’t need Tor networking, but I would like to hide my timezone and hostname, etc. Are there simple packages from Whonix that can be installed to hide it in Kicksecure?</p>
<p>Is it ‘anon-ws-base-files’?</p>

            <p>Woke up one morning with the laptop on my chest. To get Tor rocking I tried to set manually sdwdate clock like I always do, because the CMOS battery is done or something else is off since replacing the battery didint make any difference.</p>
<p>Anyway got <strong>ERROR: Login blocked after 50 attempts</strong>. Followed unlocking instructions from Unlock User Account: Excessive Wrong Password Entry Attempts on Safely Use Root Commands page.</p>
<p>Booted in to a recovery mode in GRUB/BIOS advanced options for … something.<br>
Run the      <strong>faillock --user user --reset</strong>     in the maintenance state/mode.<br>
Went back to regular kicksecure and sudo/login pw was still locked.<br>
Tried several times back and forth with no avail.<br>
Also tried only <strong>faillock</strong> command which should show list of login attempts.<br>
It told me:  <strong>faillock: Error reading tally directory: No such file or directory</strong><br>
Tried  <strong>which faillock</strong>  it told me the path to faillock, so it seems to be existing anyway.</p>
<p>To clarify I can get to desktop by turning on laptop since there is only encryption password prompt, but cant do anything sudo and if I let it idle too long the login prompt comes up and I have to reboot to get back, though I could maybe remove hibernation or whatever it is that triggers login prompt.</p>
<p>Printed all that internets had about it. Havent tried other stuff yet. Many point towards creating/touching such a directory. Dont know if I should follow strangers advice to touch hidden places. What could go wrong?</p>
<p>Still wondering how it got locked. Is it even possible to fall a sleep with hands on keyboard on such a position that the user login prompt gets saturated? Will it accept continous enter as a attempt?</p>

<p>(<strong>KickSecure</strong> / <strong>Whonix</strong>) are both solid choices when it comes to (privacy &amp; security) for a system with low (specs. CPU, RandomAccessMemory &amp; Storage). While <strong>Whonix-Host</strong> is still under heavy development and not available yet to the public, ‘sitting’ with <strong>KS</strong> is the best course of action to be taken.</p>
<p>To experiment, I’ve decided to <em>route specific site to <strong>TheOnionRouter</strong> via PAC’s script on NetworkManager</em> which it doesn’t seems to route correctly. Extensive research had been carried out by me and <em>no (resolution, resources) regarding the issue have been found</em> as of writing.</p>

            <p>Hello everyone,<br>
I’ve come to ask for your help again.<br>
I have been testing the Hunchly application for a few days. I was using their appimage and extension on Brave. At the end of the trial period I decided to delete the application and the extension.<br>
Since then, I’ve been getting a boot error: apparmor.service won’t start.</p>
<p>Here are the log messages regarding the boot error and the inability to start the service manually. The problem is clearly related to the presence of a hunchly profile in apparmor.d. But there’s no mention of this in the documentation.</p>
<p>How can I solve this problem? Thanks in advance for your solution.</p>

            <p>Hi. help me how to change zsh theme? I have .zsh file which I used in previous linux distribution. if this file replaces default .zsh in /home/user/ then only header changes. default zsh is empty (like on github). I am not advanced user and I can not find file which is responsible for commands color scheme. I found that color scheme is connected with desktop-config-dist package, but I do not understand what file is responsible for zsh colors. if I delete desktop-config-dist then other packages are also deleted - I would not like to do that. I will be grateful for help</p>

But system check always show:<br>
WARNING: Debian Package Update Check Result: apt-get reports that packages can be updated.<br>
Please update this machine:<br>
(Open a terminal, Start Menu → System → Terminal.)<br>
upgrade-nonroot<br>
Even if system is update. I checked it on my computer and a friend’s computer - always this message. Could you please change it so that this warning appears when there are non-updated packages only?</p>

            <p>Timely system updates are very important for security. It is very convenient to have notifications about new updates on desktop/panel. This is perfectly implemented in mint, mx and other distros. Many users do not check updates - one of my friends installed Kicksecure and has not updated system for a long time. He thought that there were no new updates. Such tool in new versions of Kicksecure would add convenience and security to users.<br>
Thank you</p>

Sdwdate started doing this recently.<br>
Yesterday sdwdate just finally worked for some reason.<br>
Today I have restarted it every 5-10 minutes for the last 2 hours in hope of resurrecting it.</p>
<p>Update/upgrade command times out while waiting response from proxys.<br>
Synaptic Package Manager wont connect either.<br>
also System Check program cant connect to Tor for Tor Bootstrap test.</p>
<p>So why browser connects, but rest of the toys wont?</p>

Do you think Kicksecure is the most secure host OS (or the most secure Debian OS?) or do you use it in a VM, with host Fedora, NixOS, Alpine, openSuse, Qubes…? The developers’ experience is very important and interesting. After all, you’ve studied many Linux distributions and are creating Kicksecure based on the experience of using other systems. I’m interested in your opinion at the end of 2024. And what do you think about using Nix manager in Kicksecure? What do you think about using distrobox with podman to install packages in Alpine, Fedora or other secure distros?</p>

          <title>CPU off-line on Kicksecure</title>

            <p>Hello, I wanted to create a VM on virt-manager but I noticed that it offers me 16 cpu instead of 32 because I have 2 processors of 16 threads. After some research I saw that kicksecure had indeed found 32 threads but that half of them are disabled, so I tried to enable them manually by going through the sys folder but I have no right to modify the /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/online file. How can I fix this? Thanks in advance</p>

          <title>Getting some strange errors in Whonix on a new PC</title>

            <p>I’ve been using Whonix which is based on Kicksecure for many years but I just got a new PC and now I’m having problems booting it in VirtualBox. I tried posting this on the Whonix forums but they suggested I ask here.</p>
<p>Sometimes it will boot correctly and sometimes it will get stuck. I’m often seeing strange errors/warnings around where it gets stuck which could be related. Unfortunately this forum won’t allow me to post a link or upload an image.</p>
<p>The errors seem to refer to the CPU so it might be worth mentioning I have an AMD Ryzen 7 9800x3d which has only just come out recently. Is there a known issue with this CPU?</p>
