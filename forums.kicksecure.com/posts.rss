<a name="sdwdate-source-pools-4" class="anchor" href="http://forums.kicksecure.com#sdwdate-source-pools-4"></a>sdwdate Source Pools</h2>
<p>Determining what sources should be trusted is an important issue; this is also a problem with NTP.</p>
<p>The sdwdate pools used by Kicksecure ™ are based on stable and reliable Tor onion service web servers. The pools are listed in<br>
The various onion services are categorized into three different pools. Any member in one pool should be unlikely to share logs (or other identifying data), or agree to send fake time information, with a member from the other pools. In basic terms, sdwdate picks three random servers - one from each pool - and then builds the mediate (middle position) of the three advertised dates.</p>
<p>sdwdate is only using ‘pal’ pools and not relying on ‘neutral’ and ‘foe’ pools as per tails_htp, because a good rationale for that approach has not yet been provided.</p>

<h3>
<a name="current-implementation-10-6" class="anchor" href="http://forums.kicksecure.com#current-implementation-10-6"></a>Current Implementation 1.0</h3>
<p>Prerequisite knowledge:</p>
<p>These criteria are meant to be fitting the dynamic trust of the internet and to be as close as possible to the highest trustable level.</p>
<h4>
<a name="time-source-inclusion-criteria-7" class="anchor" href="http://forums.kicksecure.com#time-source-inclusion-criteria-7"></a>Time Source Inclusion Criteria</h4>
<ul>
<li>Trustworthy. This criteria probably means many different things for many different people. To clarify, it needs to be compatible with the. Trustworthy as far as infrastructure goes, for example as in unlikely to be using cloud and/or insecure hosting for receiving confidential documents.</li>
<li>Hosted by non-anonymous organizations or persons.</li>
<li>Reachable over an <code>.onion</code> domain.</li>
<li>If there is a forced redirection from (non-TLS) http onion to TLS http<strong>s</strong> onion, the TLS certificate must be valid.</li>
<li>Highly likely to be hosted on different hardware than other sdwdate time source pool members.</li>
<li>Onion v3.</li>
<li>Must be a “real” onion service. Must not redirect to clearnet.</li>
</ul>
<p>Details:</p>
<p>It is required that each sdwdate time source pool member has both, a clearnet domain name and an onion domain name. An example of a clearnet domain name is <code>kicksecure.com</code>. An example of a onion domain name is <code>w5j6stm77zs6652pgsij4awcjeel3eco7kvipheu6mtr623eyyehj4yd.onion</code>. The clearnet domain must be reachable [TLS] with a valid TLS certificate. This is because when a website is reachable over <code>.onion</code> which has a corresponding clearnet domain name with the same contents, hosted by the same author, its easier to verify the identity of the website author, when the website was created, where the website or its maintainers are located.</p>
<p>There needs to be evidence that that onion domain is hosted by the same author as the clearnet domain. This can be a mention of the onion domain on the clearnet domain or the [<code>Onion-Location</code> HTTP header]. The latter can be conveniently noticed by visiting the website using Tor Browser and then showing <code>onion available</code> and seen by using services such as <code>securityheaders.com</code> or using the curl command line tool, i.e. <code>curl --head https://clearnet.domain</code>.</p>
<p>Onion services likely hosted on the same hardware or by the same author will be grouped together and act as one. I.e. these will be considered mirrors of the same onion. sdwdate picks one mirror from the group randomly. Any onion from that author will not be used more than other pool members. The load among these grouped pool members will therefore be load balanced.</p>
<p>Reasons:</p>
<p>This provides higher certainty of having trustworthy time source members because these websites and services services have a reputation to maintain. This includes for example e-mail services such as protonmail or big news network like The Guardian and so on. Note: Just because these are known organizations and very hard to make them operate maliciously that doesn’t mean there are guarantees whether by mistake, hacks or by outside pressure.</p>

<a name="time-sources-exclusion-criteria-11" class="anchor" href="http://forums.kicksecure.com#time-sources-exclusion-criteria-11"></a>Time Sources Exclusion Criteria</h4>
<p>The rationale for the following exclusion criteria is to avoid likely insecure websites and also to avoid any mention whatsoever of controversial content within sdwdate source code.</p>
<p>The following categories must be avoided and deleted if turning out later so:</p>
<ul>
<li>onion v2 since deprecated.</li>
<li>Unstable Website: It is not useful to add a service which is periodically unavailable.</li>
<li>Sold Out Website: It is better to remove websites there recently sold out with major content changes to be expected.</li>
<li>Website Went Offline: If the website went offline then it should removed.</li>
<li>Contain Any Form of Pornographic Content.</li>
<li>Contain or Encourage on Damaging Human Health: like drugs, alcohol, smoke, etc.</li>
<li>Contain Any Form of gore, gangs, terrorist, assassination Content.</li>
<li>Contain Deanonymization or Cracking Services or Spying Agencies: like  or the NSA, GCHQ, etc.</li>
<li>Contain or Related to Any Form of Governmental Website: like ministries or military websites or anything similar. Basically here I am working or to attach morph to my mobile app development company server side. (Specially those which end with <code>.gov</code>.)</li>
<li>Draw highly controversial attention to Kicksecure ™ or sdwdate due to their on-site or off-site activities.</li>
<li>Websites which Kicksecure ™ as default software sources (such as Debian) or potential other purposes. This is because, should there be any issues with these services (such as being down for maintenance or other issues such as being under a denial of service attack) this should not break multiple things in Kicksecure ™ such as sdwdate and APT upgrading at the same time.</li>
</ul>
<h4>
<a name="comment-field-rules-12" class="anchor" href="http://forums.kicksecure.com#comment-field-rules-12"></a>Comment Field Rules</h4>
<p>The sdwdate configuration format for onion sources is:</p>
<p><code>onion.onion # web.archive.org-link-with-evidence-onion-belong-to-corresponding-clearnet-domain optional-clearnet-link optional other comments</code></p>
<p>Or:</p>
<p><code>onion.onion # archived-link-with-evidence-onion-belong-to-corresponding-clearnet-domain mandatory-clearnet-link optional other comments</code></p>
<p>The part of the the hash ("<code>#</code>") for each pool member is shown in sdwdate logs as comment.</p>
<p>The first part of the comment must be an archived link that confirms that the onion link belongs to the organization. I.e. is not an anonymous mirror, impersonating link, fake or scam. If using web archive nothing else is required. Clearnet domain in the comment field is optional since for links that are archived on web archive it is trivial to extract the unarchived link from the web archive link.</p>
<p>If links are archived with archivers other than web archive then after the archived links there must be a space and the unarchived clearnet link.</p>
<p>After that there can be another space and additional comments.</p>
<p>In doubt just look at the many existing examples in and imitate new entries.</p>
<p>This is useful so users, reviewers can more easily see in sdwdate logs which organizations where used during sdwdate time fetching since it is hard to remember and/or cumbersume to look up that  belongs to or cumbersome to manually look up every time.</p>
<p>Confirmation that onions belong or at least did belong to a specific organisation is possible can be done either manually by opening the archived link and looking if it mentions the corresponding onion or assisted with the  script.</p>

<a name="contributor-proposed-version-20edit-13" class="anchor" href="http://forums.kicksecure.com#contributor-proposed-version-20edit-13"></a>Contributor Proposed Version 2.0[edit]</h3>
<p>It is being proposed to drop the requirement <code>hosted by non-anonymous organizations or persons</code>. I.e. onion’s hosted by anonymous organizations or persons should also be permitted under the following conditions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Here things are little bit more trickier as we cannot know much except what the website claiming to be so we cannot know who, where, how long etc. this website was running. So we need verification mechanism to check:
<ul>
<li>Consensus or Aggregation of Testimonies: We try to collect users opinions on this website and thus clearnet will be heavily involved into this specially in social media and blogs. So we can verify this website is really doing what it claims to be doing. For example, an e-mail service claiming to not spam their users should not spam their users.</li>
<li>Seniority: The older a website becomes, the more trustworthy it will be considered if there have not been any (deliberate or by mistake?) public verifiable breaches of its promises. Recently established websites cannot be with reasonable certainty considered well tested, established, being scam, fraud, deception or not.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>sdwdate checks if dates/times from remote servers (onions) are within Tor <code>consensus/valid-after</code> and <code>consensus/valid-until</code> date/time, otherwise rejects those. An example from sdwdate log.</p>
<p>2021-01-09 14:47:17 - sdwdate - INFO - * consensus/valid-after: 2021-01-09 13:00:00 2021-01-09 14:47:17 - sdwdate - INFO - * remote_time : 2021-01-09 14:49:38 2021-01-09 14:47:17 - sdwdate - INFO - * consensus/valid-until: 2021-01-09 16:00:00 2021-01-09 14:47:17 - sdwdate - INFO - * time_consensus_sanity_check: sane</p>

<a name="sdwdate-time-replay-protection-14" class="anchor" href="http://forums.kicksecure.com#sdwdate-time-replay-protection-14"></a>sdwdate Time Replay Protection</h2>
<p>Done in testers repository master. Will flow to stable as per usual.</p>
<p>sdwdate internally uses</p>
<p>Effectively, sdwdate looks at file <code>/usr/share/timesanitycheck/minimum_unixtime</code> which contains a minimum unixtime timestamp which was created by developers during development and file <code>/var/lib/sdwdate/time-replay-protection-utc-unixtime</code> which will be created every time after sdwdate has successfully set the time. sdwdate will not set time earlier than the time in these files. The purpose of this is to implement Time Replay Protection. No matter if sdwdate onion servers later give false time information due to a bug or an attack to users, the clock would never be set to a much earlier date such as year 1980 or an earlier date than the release date.</p>
<p>File <code>/usr/share/timesanitycheck/minimum_unixtime</code> will be occasionally updated by developers. It is planned to update that file at least for every release. Whenever <code>/usr/share/timesanitycheck/minimum_unixtime</code> was updated. [Time Attacks] thorough false time source replies against sdwdate with times before that time will not be possible.</p>
<p>Most users users it should not be required however users are free to create a custom extra file <code>/etc/minimum-unixtime</code> or <code>/usr/local/etc/minimum-unixtime</code> which sdwdate would also honor and never set the clock earlier than that time. All minimum unixtime files would be considered.</p>
<p>sdwdate could optionally also be instructed to ignore vendor provided file <code>/usr/share/timesanitycheck/minimum_unixtime</code>, sdwdate auto generated file <code>/var/lib/sdwdate/time-replay-protection-utc-unixtime</code> and above mentioned user custom extra file by by creating a custom override file <code>/etc/minimum-unixtime.override</code> (lower priority) or <code>/usr/local/etc/minimum-unixtime.override</code> (higher priority) which take absolute priority and result in ignoring all other minimum unixtime files. Valid values in any minimum unixtime files are only integer values. Example: <code>1611651349</code>. Minimum value is <code>0</code> which however does not make sense except for testing purposes. That would effectively disable time replay protection. For testing purposes it might be useful to set a far future date such as <code>2611651349</code> which could be temporarily enabled to test if sdwdate’s time replay protection would be functional.</p>
<h2>
<a name="sdwdate-clock-randomization-15" class="anchor" href="http://forums.kicksecure.com#sdwdate-clock-randomization-15"></a>sdwdate Clock Randomization</h2>
<p>Log example.</p>
<p>End fetching remote times. pool differences, sorted: [-35, 5, 5] median time difference: +5.000000000 randomize : -0.976225329 new time difference : +4.023774671</p>
<p>The rationale for that is that an onion time source could try to tag specific users. sdwdate uses the median time (not average) fetch result. (Average time of the 3 pools would not be be safe. To explain, suppose one pool returning a result of -1000 seconds time difference would overpower the time pools with a more realistic time difference of for example -1 and -2 seconds.)</p>
<p>Let’s say the normal distribution for most users would be <code>pool differences, sorted: [7, 5, 3]</code>. Then and onion time source could experiment with saying <code>4, 5, 6</code> to split users into different groups. This is assuming that not too many users ask the same server at the very same time. A realistic assumption given that the total number of Tor users is not that high. By adding up to <code>±</code> <code>1</code> second it gets harder to tag specific users.</p>
<p>After boot, sdwdate sets the time using the <code>date</code> after fetching times from remote.</p>
<ul>
<li>Without clock randomization: The command executed from sdwdate could be <code>sudo date --set "Tue 12 Jan 2021 06:48:55 AM UTC"</code>. This allows for more opportunities to tag user because nanoseconds are to <code>0</code> without any randomization. The full command to be run could be guessed by the sdwdate time source. Or might change from
<ul>
<li>
<code>old unixttime: 1610866967.519335985</code> to</li>
<li>
<code>new unixtime : 1610866966.519335985</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>With clock randomization: The command executed from sdwdate could be <code>sudo date --set "Tue 12 Jan 2021 06:48:55:976225329 AM UTC"</code>. Only the first part of the date/time <code>Tue 12 Jan 2021 06:48:55 AM UTC</code> can be guessed but an an extra random clock skew is introduced. The random nanoseconds part <code>976225329</code> being unpredictable by remote time sources.</li>
</ul>
<p>(These are just examples. sdwdate internally actually uses unixtime since that is easier in the program. Just to illustrate the mode of operation.)</p>
<p>If nanoseconds are randomized and later leaked to for example remote web servers, it won’t be possible for the remote web server know if clock is just skewed normally or if it was set using sdwdate with randomization. Rationale of randomization is making it look more like a naturally skewed clock.</p>
<p>Accuracy of sdwdate is far outside of <code>±</code> <code>1</code> second anyhow. Due after asking a remote onion web servers for the time and the result being relayed back through the slow Tor network to the user with hard to predict latency, nanoseconds might not matter anyhow. By the time sdwdate running <code>date</code>, nanoseconds might already be randomized without extra randomization required.</p>
<p>When supposing for the sake of threat modeling that a web server can observe clock jumps from remote because of lets say browser, javascript or something leaks it is better to jump to a randomized number of nanoseconds <code>976225329</code> than <code>000000000</code>.</p>
<p>Hope this will help everyone.</p> ]]></description>

I’m having difficulties getting the GUI package of kicksecure on my Qubes system. I followed the instructions on how to make a clone of the Debian template and install kicksecure from there on the terminal.</p>
<p>I am reading instructions on the page “install kicksecure inside Debian”.

Naturally I replaced this with <em><strong>kicksecure-qubes-gui</strong></em> because that’s the package I want to download - I want the user firendly GUI one.</p>
<p>When I entered that, it simply said “unable to locate package kicksecure-qubes-gui”. Keep in mind I followed all the other steps on the page?</p>
<p>Can someone help get me unstuck? Thanks!</p> ]]></description>

        <title>Degree of anonymity Kicksecure vs Whonix on Qubes-OS</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@iymsp]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>Hi. I am using Qubes 4.1.1 together with Kicksecure and Whonix.</p>
<p>For the last few days and in general for the last half year, I’ve been actively studying the Whonix, Kicksecure and Qubes wiki. I’m testing all installations on a test station, at the moment I’m testing all Qubes on Debian-minimal + Kicksecure-16.</p>
<p>The Whonix and Kicksecure wiki says that by hacking the AppVM an attacker can correlate between other virtual machines hacked now or much earlier. And in that case I wonder, is it anonymous to use Kicksecure for example for vlc, xmpp instead of Whonix?</p>
<p>I’m strengthening my templates as <a href="http://www.dds6qkxpwdeubwucdiaord2xgbbeyds25rbsgr73tbfpqpt4a6vjwsyd.onion/wiki/System_Hardening_Checklist" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">recommended</a> by the wiki: LKRG, Tirdad, Hardened Malloc, Hidepid, Apparmor, Security-Misc, SUID Disabler and Permission Hardener and I also disable the root account.<br>
As far as I understand it will make it a bit difficult to correlate between the hacked virtual machines, but still CPUID, CPU temperature, SSD/HDD.</p>
<p>Bottom line: Would it make sense to use copies of whonix-ws-16 for simple programs such as Liferea, vlc, xmpp instead of the minimal debian templates fortified by kicksecure and along with implemented recommendations from the wiki, like LKRG, Tirdad, etc.<br>
After all, kicksecure does not change the system name to host, and there is no whonix-firewall, does that mean it’s more anonymous to use whonix-ws-16?<br>
Separately I would like to mention proprietary programs, should they be used in Whonix if necessary ? Even when Zoom is run as User, it still sees the MAC which is the same for all virtual machines and also sees the hostname which is not changed to Host in kicksecure.<br>
But as far as I understand using many minimal templates fortified by kicksecure and together with the implemented recommendations from the wiki, on the type of LKRG, Tirdad, etc. Much better in terms of attack surface. But on the above reflection I’m having a hard time choosing.</p>
<p>A rough scheme of what I mean:<br>
<em>1) Qubes together with Kicksecure fortifications</em></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>kicksec-16-min = sys-net</li>
<li>kicksec-16-min = sys-firewall</li>
<li>kicksec-16-min = sys-usb</li>
<li>( ! ) kicksec-16-min-xmpp = xmpp-personal</li>
<li>( ! ) kicksec-16-min-zoom = zoom-work</li>
<li>whonix-ws-16 = anon-whonix</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><em>2) Qubes together with Whonix and Kicksecure:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>kicksec-16-min = sys-net</li>
<li>kicksec-16-min = sys-firewall</li>
<li>kicksec-16-min = sys-usb</li>
<li>( ! ) whonix-ws-16-xmpp = xmpp-personal</li>
<li>( ! ) whonix-ws-16-zoom = zoom-work</li>
<li>whonix-ws-16 = anon-whonix</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Will scheme 2 prevent virtual machine-to-virtual-machine correlation in case of hacking or proprietary software usage, or will it not help much and scheme 1 will be more efficient?</p>
<p>I am asking this question on Kicksecure as this question is more about Kicksecure and its advantages in terms of minimal templates.</p>
<p>I am grateful in advance and willing to listen to different views and opinions on these schemes of using Qubes together Whonix and Kicksecure.</p> ]]></description>

Removing Unnecessary packages (specially if they are not default in upstream and/or has issues like stopped development, less secure or producing too many issues).
Adding necessary packages for better security or usability (as long as they are not harmful).


Removing packages: 

Remove wget since its not upstream default and less secure than curl (kicksecure support scurl), OR replace it with the successor wget2.

Can been seen added as extra package for debian stable:

<p>But current issue is that the newly installed packages for already kicksecure users will receive an upgrade with the new packages + recommended packages (not with --no-recommends as kicksecure installed) meaning it might pull unwanted extra packages like avahi or samba or…etc</p>
<p>Current example is <a href="https://packages.debian.org/bullseye/vlc" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">VLC</a> which is installed with its recommended package (not depends) <a href="https://packages.debian.org/bullseye/vlc-plugin-samba" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"><code>vlc-plugin-samba</code></a> which install samba and smbclient libraries as a result (even if they are safe still considered extra for kicksecure installation).</p>
<p>good thing its removable without extra issues:</p>

<p>Either something by kicksecure can be done forcing packages to not pull recommends if added newly or by the end user with apt.</p>
<p>Note: This is only effecting newly added packages with previous kicksecure users, new kicksecure users will install kicksecure with --no-install-recommends as mentioned in the wiki.</p> ]]></description>

<p>Is it possible that installing Kicksecure disables this?  I have 3 Debian bullseye VMs, and the 2 that don’t (yet) have Kicksecure have networking in recovery mode - specifically, the ifup@ens3.service is active.  And apt update works.  But the VM with Kicksecure does not have networking by default in recovery mode.  Was that done intentionally or by accident?</p>
<p>The easy way to fix it is to add a networking service wants link for the rescue target:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/rescue.target.wants
ln -s /lib/systemd/system/networking.service /etc/systemd/system/rescue.target.wants/

I am not sure how that fits in here.</p>

<p>I am considering going sudo-less with root account locked, and I don’t know how much of kicksecure I can incorporate into that.  This openvt suid code is probably how I will proceed, as I now consider it a better alternative than rescue mode, as I can use it during normal operation without rebooting.  My point to posting it is to show that rescue mode does not need to be the only way to do root tasks when going sudo-less with root locked.  If relying on an unproven rescue mode was the original reason for the reluctance to do a sudo-less Kicksecure.</p>

<p>The next planned evolution of Kicksecure is however proving an ISO installation method (easier).<br>
I won’t be working on installation distribution morphing during Debian recovery mode.</p> ]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>Back on topic: Sudoless Kicksecure.  Addressing the issue about how robust the rescue boot forcing root logins is by having an alternative way to get to root that is just as secure as a rescue boot, and more secure than sudo, su, polkit, etc. as those are all susceptible to programmatic attacks by malicious software, and to misconfiguration errors.<br>
Below is a very small C program for a suid exe that will open a root console and switch back when the console exits.  This is a secure way to get to root during a normally booted (non-rescue) X or console session, and works even if the root account is locked.  I have tested that it works, and it seems secure on my own judgement, but would appreciate other opinions.  Obviously, if on a multi-user system use file permissions to only allow execution by users who can be trusted with root capabilities.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">#include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

#define OPENVT "/usr/bin/openvt"

/* Establish a very basic and safe environment for the VT session.  Note:
 * if we don't set SHELL, then a very simple attack would be to set SHELL
 * to a malicious exe and run this suid, with the result that the malicious
 * exe would get root privileges. */
char *vtenv[] = {
	"PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin",
	"SHELL=/usr/bin/bash",
	"TERM=linux",
	"LOGNAME=root",
	"HOME=/root",
	"USER=root",
	NULL};

int main() {
	/* really become root: */
	setreuid(0, 0);
	setregid(0, 0);
	/* null-out stdin,stdout,stderr to prevent redirect-IO attacks: */
	int nullfp = open("/dev/null", O_RDWR);
	dup2(nullfp, 0);
	dup2(nullfp, 1);
	dup2(nullfp, 2);
	/* openvt options used:
	 * -l makes it a login session by prefixing the shell with '-'
	 * -s switches to the VT
	 * -w waits for exit from the VT and switches back
	 * The problem with using -e /usr/bin/bash instead of setting SHELL to /usr/bin/bash
	 * is that -e interferes with -w.
	 * */
	execle(OPENVT,OPENVT,"-lsw",NULL,vtenv);
	return 0;
