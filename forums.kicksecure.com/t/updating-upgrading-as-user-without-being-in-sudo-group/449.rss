    <title>Updating/upgrading as user without being in sudo group?</title>
    <link>https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/updating-upgrading-as-user-without-being-in-sudo-group/449</link>
    <description>So the way I installed Kicksecure was without granting root rights to user to lock it down better.
How can I make it so user can still do upgrade-nonroot without adding user to the sudo group? 

Would changing the permissions to the `upgrade-nonroot` and `apt-get-update-plus` achieve this?

`chmod 755 /usr/bin/upgrade-nonroot`

`chmod 755 /usr/bin/apt-get-update-plus`

Would this be a stupid idea? (just want to be able to use user to update/upgrade not install packages)</description>
