    <title>Using Kicksecure XFCE VM as offline Cold Storage</title>
    <link>http://forums.kicksecure.com/t/using-kicksecure-xfce-vm-as-offline-cold-storage/122</link>
    <description>Hello, dear users and developers!

I have a question. Is it possible/wise/endorsed-by-developers to use Kicksecure XFCE OS in VirtualBox as completely offline virtual machine for cold storage? If the answer is &quot;yes&quot;, then how to properly configure both virtual machine and Kicksecure settings for that purpose?

Is it enough to just disable network in VirtualBox settings for Kicksecure?
Or should I also disable such things as System Check and sdwdate inside Kicksecure somehow since there is no internet connection anyway? Which time should I set in such case to be secure?

Thank you very much for your work on Whonix, and for your answer in advance too! :slight_smile:</description>
