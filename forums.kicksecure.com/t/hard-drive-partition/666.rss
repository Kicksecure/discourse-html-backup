    <description>I have 2 partitions that seem to live off my only drive that has kicksecure on. These 2 partitions are 42 GIG each. What are these for? They say they are swap partitions but Ive never seen something like that and can I reallocate them to the main partition?</description>

            <p>That looks fairly normal.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>/boot/efi</code> partition is an EFI System Partition. This is used to store the GRUB bootloader. It is required for the system to be able to boot.</li>
<li>The <code>/boot</code> partition is used for storing the kernel, initramfs, and bootloader configuration. It is intentionally separate from the rest of the system in order to allow for more secure drive encryption.</li>
<li>Then you have your crypt partition, which contains your root filesystem. That stores the rest of the OS.</li>
<li>The 38.8G swap partition isn’t actually a partition, but is a swap <em>file</em>. Kicksecure’s <code>swap-file-creator</code> creates an encrypted volume within a file, and then uses that encrypted volume for swap, thus providing encrypted swap that is secure even if the rest of your system is unencrypted or if your system’s decryption key is ever stolen. It appears that <code>swap-file-creator</code> is making a swapfile based on the size of your system’s RAM, and you have a lot of RAM? How much RAM does this system have?</li>
</ul>
<p>At any rate, if you don’t want swap at all, I believe you can use <code>sudo systemctl disable swap-file-creator</code> and then reboot.</p>

            <p>Could you share the output of <code>sudo fdisk -l</code> so we can see your partition layout?</p>
