    <title>Using Python3 with KickSecure</title>
    <link>https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/using-python3-with-kicksecure/311</link>
    <description>Hi!
I&#39;m working on a project where I must use the Python package metadata-parser, which for some reason has no debian counterpart for direct HTML scraping of the internet.  Anyway when I used Kicksecure on Debian 11 I was able to use PIP to grab the python package.  Now that I&#39;m on Debian 12 I&#39;m getting some solid error messages.  So this support request is to be shown the correct approach of respecting KickSecures security measures.  Should I use the virtual environment for Python as they recommend.
Error Message on trying to use PIP:

&gt; [user ~/]% su -c &#39;pip install metadata-parser&#39; (also tried sudo and nosudo)
&gt; Password: 
&gt; error: externally-managed-environment
&gt; 
&gt; × This environment is externally managed
&gt; ╰─&gt; To install Python packages system-wide, try apt install
&gt;     python3-xyz, where xyz is the package you are trying to
&gt;     install.
&gt;     
&gt;     If you wish to install a non-Debian-packaged Python package,
&gt;     create a virtual environment using python3 -m venv path/to/venv.
&gt;     Then use path/to/venv/bin/python and path/to/venv/bin/pip. Make
&gt;     sure you have python3-full installed.
&gt;     
&gt;     If you wish to install a non-Debian packaged Python application,
&gt;     it may be easiest to use pipx install xyz, which will manage a
&gt;     virtual environment for you. Make sure you have pipx installed.
&gt;     
&gt;     See /usr/share/doc/python3.11/README.venv for more information.
&gt; 
&gt; note: If you believe this is a mistake, please contact your Python installation or OS distribution provider. You can override this, at the risk of breaking your Python installation or OS, by passing --break-system-packages.
&gt; hint: See PEP 668 for the detailed specification.
&gt; zsh: exit 1     su -c &#39;pip install metadata-parser&#39;</description>
