    <description>Hi Patrick,

I see Aaron Rainbolt is only active since end 2022. Who is this guy? How can have so much knowledge while only being publicly active for 2 years? A Kicksecure coder has a lot of responsibilities. 

Please triple check all his code and be sure it&#39;s not a bad actor like with xz</description>

            <p>Slight correction - I’ve been active in the open-source world since mid-April 2022, having gotten involved in Lubuntu early in the Kinetic Kudu release cycle. You can see some of my first bug fixing activity here: <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/calamares-settings-ubuntu/+bug/1966774" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Bug #1966774 “btrfs partioning with calamares results in unboota...” : Bugs : calamares-settings-ubuntu package : Ubuntu</a> But still, that’s not a whole lot of time, so you raise a valid concern and careful review is a very good idea. (Besides, I’m a human and make mistakes, and peer review helps keep those from getting into the finished product.)</p>
