    <title>Lost operability after update</title>
    <link>https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/lost-operability-after-update/318</link>
    <description>hello all,

A bit of a tech dumbass as the name indicates, so apologies for not knowing basics. Am a journo trying to learn more a secure OS.

Installing KS Debian XFCE took about a week trying all sorts of suggestions and still not got both modules running properly. But for now my latest update attempts appear to have borked my installation.

Was running Debian 11 bullseye 
did a sudo apt update + upgrade
came back to desktop to find mouse frozen.
rebooted, twice, thrice and mouse worked for awhile.
at one stage, not even the Kicksecure home page loaded properly i.e. links not clickable. 

Now showing Debian 12 but functionality comes and goes.
For example, Synaptic is no longer loadable from menu, only terminal. Sometimes it disappears between alt-tab programme switching.  
No matter what terminal commands I try, however, terminal output always ends with same eight (now nine) errors:

Errors were encountered while processing:
 linux-headers-6.1.0-11-amd64
 linux-image-6.1.0-11-amd64
 linux-headers-amd64
 linux-image-amd64
 tirdad-dkms
 tirdad
 kicksecure-cli-host-packages-recommended
 kicksecure-cli-host
 kicksecure-xfce-host

[Full terminal output](https://anonpaste.pw/v/36413d02-8ce9-44ed-b0a4-642bb6e66d73#lH0GpNXT3knVypo1eMdWowzuiSK464WISMH7umZDBPE)

Have spent days on trying to solve this and searched literally dozens of help pages, forums, and note that there is not one result for [kicksecure] on the [recommended](https://unix.stackexchange.com/search?q=%5Bkicksecure%5D+file+not+found) stack exchange page, so am trying here as it seems more active. 

Trying not to take valuable time and have read [Posting links for new users](https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Forum_Best_Practices#Posting_Links_for_New_Users) 

Some of the other things I&#39;ve seen over the last few days:

**General notes on experience**

* Right click not working on desktop or anywhere else, including programmes eg Librewrite.

* Ctrl-v not working.

* Host OS Kicksecure start button not responding to clicks, can still access programmes via alt-f3

* VB opens but VM whonix gateway not working: No response to clicks on VM start, settings, or VB screen maximisation/minimasation

* Can open but not close functions in LibreWrite, eg can open and run spell check but spell check does not respond to x (top-right) box click, not able to tab to (bottom right) x close box. Have to restart LibreWrite to close Spellcheck.

* Librewrite select-all works via ctrl+A, but clicking on the selected text box does not enable editing, only pressing the keyboard down arrow releases the selection for editing.

* Cannot click already-open programmes via top toolbar tabs, can only switch between open programmes via alt+tab on keyboard.

* About XFCE tab opens, but close button does not work. Red upper-right close x does work.

Tried removing and reinstalling VirtualBox but still same problems. 

Overall, like others moving to Debian 12, the system now seems to have settled down from the above experiences. But am unable to remove programmes I&#39;ve installed via Synaptic eg Signal, due to above errors.

Sorry for long post, and any advice grovelling welcome.

NOT A NINJA
