        <title>Consider battery charging thresholds and optimizations</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@arraybolt3]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>First off, <strong>please, DO NOT paste random things from AI into a bug report or feature request that you send to ANY open-source project, without clearly and unambiguously marking it as AI-generated.</strong> All of the TLP options you mention don’t even exist or have different names than the ones shown here, and the option you show for “disabling desktop effects” on Cinnamon is badly mangled.</p>
<p>Rant over, as for the suggestions you mention here, I sadly have negative feedback on all of them. Some of them do potentially have merit, like disabling animations and compositors, but I’m worried that people will misinterpret those changes as bugs.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I personally do not like the idea of adding TLP. For some people it works great, but for others it can cause their system to be unstable and freeze or crash in certain situations. The way it works is it tweaks kernel-level settings to reduce power consumption, which can cause problems if the settings it enables aren’t compatible with your system for whatever reason. This is an annoyance at best, at worst it could be a security hole or open a security hole, if it chooses to tweak a setting that has security implications.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I’m somewhat adverse to this, for a couple of reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Kicksecure is using XFCE, not GNOME, so I don’t know if this will have any effect on the ISO or VM images. I haven’t seen any animations in the XFCE session. (We have no intention to switching to GNOME because of security concerns, see <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Dev/GNOME" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Dev/GNOME - Kicksecure</a>)</li>
<li>Some people are probably using Kicksecure with GNOME by way of using <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Debian" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">distribution morphing</a>. I don’t think these people will expect all animations to be disabled when installing or upgrading Kicksecure. This could cause a lot of bug reports.</li>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The correct command to use here is actually <code>gsettings set org.cinnamon desktop-effects false</code> I believe, though I haven’t tested this. I don’t really like this idea for the same reason I don’t like disabling GNOME animations - it’s not going to affect most Kicksecure systems at all, and on the systems it does effect, it could look like a bug.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Disable compositing for full-screen windows</strong> <em>xfce</em> (may also apply to other Desktop Environments)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is not what that option does. That disables compositing entirely.</p>
<p>As for whether that’s desirable, I guess for some people it might be? The problem is that without compositing, some applications will render entirely wrong (this is most notable with GNOME Web / Epiphany, where it insists on trying to draw shadows even without a running compositor and you end up with massive solid black margins around some UI elements, I think Firefox may also do this). If this doesn’t break Firefox, it <em>might</em> be OK, but even that could cause serious problems for some users.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>On KDE If you want to disable the compositor entirely</strong> (which will affect all windows, not just full-screen ones), you can do so with the following command:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I didn’t audit this command to see if it actually does what the post says. I <em>know</em> this causes problems with Firefox because it did for me just the other day, so I don’t think this is a good idea either. For reference, this is what my Kubuntu system does when you turn compositing off using <kbd>Alt+Shift+F12</kbd> while Firefox is running:</p>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>It is highly unlikely that the Kicksecure project will work on this. It’s not on the roadmap (such as <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Security_Roadmap" class="inline-onebox">Kicksecure Security Roadmap</a>) which we’ll have our hands full with for the next years. Wiki chapter <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Reporting_Bugs#Community_Feedback">Community Feedback</a> applies.</p>
<p>If you want to see this feature materialize, I recommend to request this feature from other projects and/or working on it yourself.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The openSUSE package for this boot loader contains more than 200 patches. Some of those patches are there for the last 5, 6 … 10 years. That is both an indication of the talent of the maintainers, but also can signal an issue in how slow the upstream contribution process can be.</p>

        <title>Installing FDE LUKS with Detached LUKS header option</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@arraybolt3]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>This is probably feasible, though I can’t say if it’s something that I’ll definitely work on or not. Some notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kicksecure doesn’t use GRUB to unlock encrypted disks. This is because we use Debian’s GRUB, and Debian’s GRUB only has very bad LUKS support (only supports LUKS1, can’t handle non-US keyboard layouts, ugly, slow, only gives you one shot to unlock the drive, and then the Linux kernel has to unlock the drive <em>again</em> once it boots). Instead, we use an unencrypted /boot partition and let the initramfs handle decrypt. This lets us use more secure encryption, provides a better user interface for decryption, works with multiple keyboard layouts, and works faster.</li>
<li>Plausible deniability should not be relied upon unless you know exactly what you’re doing. It’s well known that such a thing exists, and it’s pretty uncommon for people to have a random block of “unallocated” (or allocated-but-unformatted) space on their disk. If you’re in enough danger to consider needing plausible deniability, you’re in enough danger for even random data to look suspicious if it’s at all unusual.</li>

        <title>Installing FDE LUKS with Detached LUKS header option</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@JuicyOdds]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>You know there are great things that have been discussed/mentioned in the other thread called “BusKill” which shreds the LUKS header. Which leads to the data being useless due to it being no different then random data forensically.</p>
<p>Instead of that it would be better if Kicksecure developed the feature and option when selecting Full Disk Encryption via LUKS at installation. <strong>To have the option to detach the LUKS header</strong> and store it on another device whether that be a USB, SD Card, Smart Card, Yubikey, Nitrokey, etc.</p>
<p>The main development would be the integration into Grub as it would have to ask for device or detect a saved device that has the luks header aswell as ask for the passphrase. The other integration would be into the graphical installer (e.g. Calamares) for selecting such a option.</p>
<p>Currently there is no option to set up a Linux install with FDE and a detached header. However this implementation would greatly servers and personal computers alike.</p>
<p>Here is a good read about this topic.</p>
<p>skrilnetz .net/bullet-proof-data-encryption-with-luks-and-a-detached-header/</p>
<p><strong>In summery here are the Benefits:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Enhanced Security</strong>: – By separating the header from the encrypted data, users can reduce the risk of unauthorized access to their encrypted storage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Flexibility</strong>: – Users can choose to store the header in a more secure location, such as a different device or a secure cloud storage solution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Improved Usability</strong>: – This feature would cater to advanced users who require additional security measures for their sensitive data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Plausible Denial</strong>: – By using a detached header, users can claim that the encrypted storage contains random data, as the absence of the header makes it impossible to decrypt the contents without the correct key. This provides a layer of plausible deniability, as users can assert that they do not possess the means to access the data.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>In general, I really like the idea of using hardware security tokens (USB, TPM, HSM, etc) for use as a <em>second</em> factor.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we see a lot of systems (ab)using this tech as a single factor. I think it would be wise to make sure your LUKS unlocking <em>always</em> requires the user to input a something-you-know secret.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>but maybe someone will be interested in this. I would appreciate it. my experience: system won’t boot on linux mint if  disk is encrypted by luks:<br>

<p>If I run kubunta 24.10 with an luks, live mode run from disk, not ram. I don’t see any errors in logs, so not sure what exactly to look for and try. I always installed dracut - otherwise live mode doesn’t start at all. Could you please advise - if live mode run from disk, where could problem be? I would be very grateful!!! Or maybe someone more experienced can try running live mode on kubuntu or ubuntu 24.10 with luks. I am not a very experienced linux user</p> ]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>At the time of writing, verified boot with reasonable security and usability using user-custom keys for Open Source Linux desktop distributions comparable to some Android hardware is unavailable due to a lack of hardware/firmware support (at least on the Intel/AMD64 platform).</p>
<p>The gigantic <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Verified_Boot">verified boot</a> wiki page has grown as large as it has because <a class="mention" href="https://forums.kicksecure.com/u/arraybolt3">@arraybolt3</a> and I have been trying to wrap our heads around how verified boot with reasonable security, usability, and user-custom keys for Open Source (Linux) distributions, comparable to some Android hardware, could be implemented.</p>
<p>Sponsor PUP (related: <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Transparency">Transparency</a>) will pay an OEM with firmware development skills to revise that wiki page with the goal of drafting a concept on how this could be implemented and identifying areas that might require further research.</p>
<p>If we are lucky, and if financially feasible, this might result in the development of hardware/firmware that allows for full verified boot to be implemented and actually realized.</p> ]]></description>

        <title>Onion APT repositories connection timeouts solution?</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@Quiksilver]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>Tor onion APT repositories can sometimes fail when updating. This can can happen due to the slowness of generated onion circuits or having a custom <code>/etc/tor/torrc</code> can cause them to timeout when updating.</p>
<p>In fact the Tails project since 6.4 removed the onion Debian repositories</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Switch to using HTTPS addresses instead of an onion addresses for the Debian and Tails APT repositories. This makes the Additional Software feature more reliable.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://tails.net/news/version_6.4/index.en.html" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Tails - Tails 6.4</a></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>I created a config <code>/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/99timeout</code></p>
<p>(15 seconds till timeout, 5 seconds till retry, and retries 3 times.)</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">Acquire::http::Timeout "15";
Acquire::http::Retry-After "5";
Acquire::Retries "3";
</code></pre>
<p>I’m not sure how the integration tor and APT works but this would only effect http repos which also are what onions are.</p>
<p>This configuration seemed to work for me but I’m not sure if this fix is placebo?</p>
<p>In closing I don’t think Kicksecure should follow the same route of removing Onion repositories or Onion Debian repositories as thats one thing i strongly disagree with choice of the other project.</p> ]]></description>

        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@arraybolt3]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>I don’t want to assume bad faith here, but I think Proudmuslim either doesn’t know what they’re talking about, is intentionally making this sound worse than it is, or just hasn’t thought this through fully. Rather than just saying “this really isn’t the problem it looks like”, allow me to take the opportunity to use this as a small course on how to determine what is and isn’t a problem security-wise.</p>
<p>First off, before we even look at the problem, we have to define our threat model. What are we trying to protect? What does a compromise look like? What is necessary to cause a compromise? What needs to be done to prevent that? These are questions only each individual user can answer for themselves, since everyone is protecting something different and for different reasons. But for the most part, you can break up data that needs protected into three general zones, with some overlap:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data that you need to remain <em>private</em>. Things like tax records, personally identifying information, passwords, secret encryption keys, chats with your friends or workplace, documents containing business trade secrets, things that could get you put in jail if you’re arrested in the wrong country like religious texts, etc.</li>
<li>Data that you need to remain <em>unmodified</em>. Reports for your business, bulk data that needs to be analyzed, application source code, stuff like this. Most of this stuff may be semi-public (or even entirely public), but if someone is able to modify it other than you, things could go very wrong (for instance if someone injects malicious code into a software project you’re working on).</li>
<li>Data that you need to remain <em>accessible</em>. Grocery lists, instructions, notes on how to perform tasks, computer programs, etc. It’s probably not the end of the world if someone managed to get ahold of any of this data, but you’d quickly find yourself in a bind if <em>you</em> couldn’t get access to it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these is a security problem, and these three aspects are generally referred to with the acronym <strong>CIA</strong> - <strong>C</strong>onfidentiality, <strong>I</strong>ntegrity, and <strong>A</strong>vailability. These are the things you need to look at to decide how you need to protect your data.</p>
<p>For me personally, I use a single-user computer. No one else has a legitimate reason to access to my device without my direct supervision, and everything done on that device is done by me or with me watching. The root account is locked since there’s no reason for anyone to log into it except for me, and I can just use <code>sudo</code> if I need root access. The data I need to protect is roughly:</p>
<ul>
<li>Authentication credentials of various kinds (passwords, TOTP codes for 2FA, a few security keys for Matrix, my browser’s cookies, and my GPG and SSH keys). These are mostly a confidentiality concern - integrity and availability are both important but definitely secondary. It would be a <em>mess</em> if I lost my email password. It would be a <em>much, <strong>much</strong> bigger mess</em> someone got into my email.</li>
<li>Source code for a slew of projects, most of which is open-source but some of which are closed-source (internal work stuff). Confidentiality is a concern for the closed-source repos, but for the most part integrity is of the utmost concern here. I absolutely cannot afford for someone to implant malicious code into any of the repos I work on and have it look like I put it there. Availability is a low-priority issue - if I lose the repos, I can just clone them again.</li>
<li>Financial data. Confidentiality and availability are the highest priorities here, integrity is directly tied to availability here so really it’s a high priority also. Financial data is interesting because the compromise of <em>any</em> of the C, I, A attributes is a disaster. This is part of why there are such strong protections around it.</li>
<li>Some personal info that I care deeply about, like pictures and documents. Here integrity and availability trump everything else. Confidentiality is nice, but if it was broken I probably wouldn’t panic too much.</li>
<li>Emails. Confidentiality is the highest priority here, integrity and availability are useful but not as important. I’ll live if some emails are corrupted or if I can’t access my inbox for a few days. I’ll have some serious issues if someone snoops on all my private communications.</li>
<li>My operating system and applications. I don’t care about confidentiality here but, integrity is a critical priority because if it’s compromised, everything else can be compromised, and availability is a critical priority because if it’s compromised, I can’t work.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now if you look at all of the above, one thing becomes very clear - <strong>if someone gets access to my user account, I’m toast long before they get root access.</strong> If someone is even able to get to the point where they <em>can</em> try to get a root shell, I have much bigger problems than a privilege escalation attempt. Another thing is less obvious but still important - if you want to get root access on my system, you <em>have</em> to get user access first. That’s because it’s a single-user system. Putting the two together, <em>the ability to compromise my system’s root account is a total non-issue.</em> No matter what you do to get root on my system, you’ve fully compromised me already.</p>
<p>Now this might just be my use case but how many people do you know who use a desktop computer? What do they do with it? Would they be compromised just by getting access to their user account, like I would? 99% of the time the answer is going to be “absolutely yes”. So for a usual desktop use case, there’s really little to no reason to protect the root account. You want to focus your efforts on keeping unauthorized people out of your user account.</p>
<p>So where is root access a concern? There are probably a lot of good answers here, but the three scenarios are:</p>
<ul>
<li>You’re protecting a multi-user workstation. If someone can compromise one user account, they only get the data from that one user. If you want the data from all the users, you either have to compromise every single user individually, or you have to compromise root at which point everyone else is automatically compromised.</li>
<li>You’re protecting a server. If you compromise a service like a web server, you probably won’t get access to much useful data. Getting root gives you access to much, <em>much</em> more data, which is useful to an attacker.</li>
<li>You’re using a hypervisor, and are trying to defend against VM escapes. This may come as a surprise, but a lot of VM escape vulnerabilities are only really a problem if malware can get root within the VM first. Protecting the root account of individual VMs is therefore a form of defense-in-depth against VM escape compromises.</li>
</ul>
<p>Are all of these scenarios important? Absolutely. But for the typical desktop user, they really don’t have to worry about this (with the exception of Qubes OS users, where the last point may be important, but even then it’s not that important).</p>
<p>So far I’ve defined what we’re protecting. The next step would usually be to determine how one would compromise it. I don’t want to go into extreme detail here, but short of a physical attack (someone sitting at your laptop while it’s unlocked), the most severe risk for a typical desktop use case is if someone can execute arbitrary code as my user account. If they can do that, they can read <em>almost</em> anything they want if my account can access it (near-total loss of confidentiality), modify <em>almost</em> whatever my account can access (near-total loss of integrity), and delete anything my account has write access to (total loss of availability). (The qualifier “almost” when it comes to confidentiality and integrity is because I have password protection on my GPG key, and I don’t store that password anywhere, so they wouldn’t be able to sign things with my key or read things encrypted to me with GPG.)</p>
<p>How do people get arbitrary code execution on your machine? There are two very common techniques:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trick the user into running code the attacker provides. This is by far the most common strategy, and is sadly <em>extremely</em> effective. Social engineering can break even the best software-level security strategy, Users can and will click “install” on a malicious application or paste malware into their terminal. (Many OSes try to prevent this, but they either fail miserably, or the protections end up causing serious problems for the user.)</li>
<li>Provide data to the user that, when read by a vulnerable application, tricks the application into running code embedded in the data. This sounds hard (and it is), but it’s a very common way to attack businesses. The exact way in which this works is an entire field of research of its own, so suffice it to say “it can be done in a lot of situations”.</li>
</ul>
<p>Kicksecure and Whonix attempt to make both of the above attacks <em>very</em> difficult:</p>
<ul>
<li>To prevent social engineering, Kicksecure and Whonix provide extensive wikis to teach the user how to keep themselves secure. This mitigates social engineering attacks.</li>
<li>To prevent application compromise, Kicksecure uses extensive kernel parameters and other security-related settings to make it so that if an application is exploited, it will present a number of obstacles to the attacker that they probably weren’t expecting or can’t get around. In practice, this means that a hacked application will (hopefully) be more likely to crash than to compromise your system. Some applications use AppArmor sandboxing for additional safety, and we also do security reviews on quite a bit of code that we think might be security-sensitive.</li>
</ul>
<p>Do we worry about protecting the root account? Yes, but in many ways it’s a secondary pursuit to the above. It’s still something we’re pursuing (we actually have a whole project dedicated to this called <code>user-sysmaint-split</code> that we’ve been working on like crazy lately), but it’s not the end of the world that Proudmuslim is making it sound like.</p>
<p>Lastly, I’d like to illustrate what it would take for the attack Proudmuslim references to actually be exploited. The attack is, in short, “run <code>upgrade-nonroot</code>, then instruct apt to give you a root shell if it runs into a conffile conflict.” This is <em>not</em> anywhere near as easy as they make it sound. For one, conffile conflicts in Debian and Kicksecure aren’t at all common unless you’re a sysadmin that messes with package conffiles. Even if you do mess with package conffiles, you’re not all that likely to run into conffile prompts since the default configuration for packages isn’t changed very often. For two, anything you could do to intentionally trigger a conffile prompt requires root access already. Either you’d have to be able to install attacker-controlled packages onto the victim’s computer (at which point, just put your malicious code in a package postinst script, boom, compromise complete), or you’d have to be able to see a particular package upgrade is coming through that <em>would</em> cause a conffile conflict prompt if a particular file was modified, then modify that file, and then upgrade the system. Modifying conffiles virtually always requires root access (if it doesn’t, your system is probably broken or a package on the system is very poorly designed), so if you can modify conffiles, you don’t need to bother with getting an apt conffile prompt. You have root access already.</p>
<p>So ultimately, this is really not hardly a problem. Is it a problem at all? I’d say yeah, sorta, and most likely we’ll fix it once we push out <code>user-sysmaint-split</code>. But this isn’t even remotely close to the end of the world.</p>
<p>If you’re worried about this issue, and want to fix it now, you can run <code>sudo mv /etc/sudoers.d/upgrade-passwordless /etc/sudoers-d-upgrade-passwordless.old</code> or something similar. This will prevent <code>upgrade-nonroot</code> (and the <code>apt-get-update-plus</code> command it uses in the background) from being run as root without a password.</p> ]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>OK sure, I’ll fix that and make some improvements.<br>
I’ve been doing a bunch of test builds to ensure a working environment.</p>
<p><code>sddm</code> for the X11 version is probably a nicer fit, because it depends on a lot of QT libraries that are required anyway, but won’t be included in <code>lxqt-core</code>.<br>
<code>lxqt-core</code> with <code>--no-install-recommends</code> is possible with minor additions.<br>
And lastly, <code>kwin-wayland</code> really looks to be the only compositor not suffering from the qemu bug.</p>
<p>Just the DE and compositor will be around ~350MB. It could be squeezed tighter by not using the lxqt meta-package and directly picking only crucial dependencies, but I think it’s fine.</p>
<p>I’ll update the list so you guys have something to go on when the time comes.</p> ]]></description>

        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@Patrick]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>That’s probably true.</p>
<p>The conditions to run into this issue are probably rare. The user must lock down user/root isolation as well as modify a package managed configuration file in <code>/etc</code>, later get compromised.</p>
<p>That tweet sounds dramatic. It assumes a concept (such as <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Dev/user-sysmaint-split" class="inline-onebox">user-sysmaint-split</a>) for meaningful user/root isolation is already a standard feature, which isn’t the case.</p>
<p>By the time an attacker can run this attack, the has user has usually already bigger issues. The following XKCD applies.</p>
<p><a href="https://xkcd.com/1200/" class="inline-onebox">xkcd: Authorization</a></p>
<p>That tweet also seems to completely disregard any prior accomplishments an has the mindset “found 1 issue → trash the whole thing”, which isn’t productive.</p>
<p>Since user-sysmaint-split is due to become the default for new images with the next release, this report comes at a good time. That might be the end of <code>upgrade-nonroot</code> for account <code>user</code> for the foreseeable future. Other way solutions in the future, related:</p>

        <title>Exclusive Authentication Token</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@MasonicMazer]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p><strong>Proposal for</strong> <strong>Exclusive Authentication Token</strong>:</p>
<p>system multifactor auth and killswitch in one user-tethered dongle</p>
<p>Secure boot can be implemented in Kicksecure for platform binding, but what about other hardware-engaging options like locking LUKS with a security key?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>search: support nitrokey com – Unlocking LUKS with a USB key on Fedora/Qubes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>search: Fedora forum - which dracut method (Yubikey)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What does the Kicksecure team think about measured boot (HEADS BIOS) and Anti-Evil Maid (see AEM - Qubes OS + TPM)?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>BusKill</em> by Michael Altfield (on github) utilizes an app that triggers a hotplug removal event (in libusb) and a specific drive and port can be designated (usb: 00x , 00x) so that other USB devices do not trigger the shutdown.</p>
<p>Therefore, <strong>a single usb device could both</strong> authenticate LUKS cryptab with FIDO (biometric and/or unique physical token) and trigger a hotplug removal event in libusb on the BusKill application (python, sha256, .btz).</p>
<p>Would Kicksecure approve of this feature or can anyone on the development team find any security flaw with this technique being implemented?</p>
<p>In TAILS OS, all one has to do is attach a lanyard to the TAILS USB device and wrap the cord around your wrist. If the computer is forcefully removed from you, both the shutdown sequence is initiated and the RAM is cleared and persistent storage is again locked in the FDE state. However, if developer mode is and security-misc is fully enabled on Kicksecure, one has to wait for sudo shutdown and if unencumbered on the stable or testing mode, the computer could be stolen while in an unlocked state.</p> ]]></description>

<p>derivative-maker could get an option to <code>--desktop x11</code> / <code>--desktop wayland</code>. Not sure that’s worth it before port to Debian trixie where we might got all-in on Wayland and no longer support X11.</p> ]]></description>

        <title>How to go out of hibernation?</title>

Sleep is what usually happens when you close a machine’s lid - it goes into a power-saving state that can be resumed from quickly. Hibernation is when your system writes all of its memory contents to disk and then shuts down entirely (sorta). Sleep should be very well supported, and if it doesn’t work that’s a bug. Hibernation on the other hand has a tendency to be finicky on Linux (and Windows too, but Linux moreso).</p> ]]></description>

The primary use for this would be portable installations, where someone does a full install of a distro onto a USB flash drive that they then intend to run on multiple physical machines with varying types of firmware. Currently Calamares can only install the bootloader matching the firmware type of the system being booted though. This PR attempts to change that by adding an option `installHybridGRUB` to `bootloader.conf`. When enabled, Calamares will attempt to install both BIOS and UEFI GRUB bootloaders.

Note, I'm not sure if the approach I'm taking here is correct - it seems a bit overly hacky. This PR also isn't complete - it still needs to tackle a problem with partitioning (namely, the EFI system partition is only made on EFI systems, so on BIOS systems, one has to specify an ESP themselves in partition.conf... but if you do that, you end up with two ESPs on EFI systems, because Calamares will add an ESP regardless of whether one already exists in the partition layout or not).</span></p>

        <title>How to go out of hibernation?</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@gredhurk]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p><a class="mention" href="https://forums.kicksecure.com/u/arraybolt3">@arraybolt3</a> It was host. Sorry for no feedback. Problem somehow solved itself out. Most likely system freezed? (i used it intensively before hibernation) When returned everything was normal and system went out of hibernation correctly. So i can’t explain much more. Thanks for help anyway. I will avoid hibernation. <a class="mention" href="https://forums.kicksecure.com/u/sam">@sam</a></p> ]]></description>

        <title>How to change swap-file-creator settings?</title>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>Thanks for your help! I’ve disabled the swap file creator. Sorry for the late thank you. I’m still short of time and for the moment I haven’t managed to study the swap configuration in depth… I’m not a linux system specialist…</p> ]]></description>
