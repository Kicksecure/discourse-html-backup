    <title>Systemcheck hangs up on Time Synchronization</title>
    <link>http://forums.kicksecure.com/t/systemcheck-hangs-up-on-time-synchronization/162</link>
    <description>I recently updated Gateway and Workstation to 16.0.4 running out of Virtual Box. I had some connectivity issues and had to update usr/local/etc/torrc.d/50_user.conf

Now everything seems to work fine but I still can&#39;t connect to Tor due to a Time Synchronization error. When I run systemcheck I get the following message:

&gt; [ERROR] [systemcheck] Time Synchronization Result:
&gt; systemcheck gave up waiting.
&gt; 
&gt; Time synchronization status: fail
&gt; sdwdate reports: Maximum allowed number of failures. Giving up.

Checking the sdwdate logs gives me some more info:

&gt; ### START: ### /usr/libexec/helper-scripts/onion-time-pre-script
&gt; __ Status: Subsequent run after boot.
&gt; __ Static Time Sanity Check: Within minimum time &#39;Fri Feb 18 00:00:00 UTC 2022&#39; and expiration timestamp &#39;Tue May 17 10:00:00 UTC 2033&#39;, ok.
&gt; __ Tor reports: NOTICE BOOTSTRAP PROGRESS=100 TAG=done SUMMARY=&quot;Done&quot;
&gt; __ Tor circuit: established
&gt; __ Tor Consensus Time Sanity Check: Clock within consensus parameters consensus/valid-after 2022-11-28 14:00:00 and consensus/valid-until 2022-11-28 17:00:00.
&gt; __ Conclusion: Tor already reports circuit established.
&gt; __ ### END: ### Exiting with exit_code &#39;0&#39; indicating &#39;success&#39;.
&gt; 2022-11-28 14:59:21 - sdwdate - INFO - PREPARATION RESULT: SUCCESS.

But when the Onions are pulled in to establish the time, all URLs produce the same error message:

&gt; Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 111] Connection refused

Ultimately ending with the summary:
&gt; 2022-11-28 14:59:22 - sdwdate - INFO - failed_urls: 9 allowed_failures: 7
&gt; 2022-11-28 14:59:22 - sdwdate - ERROR - Maximum allowed number of failures. Giving up.
&gt; 2022-11-28 14:59:22 - sdwdate - INFO - Sleeping for 90 minutes, ok.

I&#39;ve tried restarting sdwdate, restarting network and restarting Tor via Gateway and Workstation. I&#39;ve also tried setting the time/date manually but this didn&#39;t fix anything. Can someone tell me where I&#39;m going wrong?</description>
