        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@sam]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>Thank you very much, friend!</p>
<p>I tested LMDE again and could not reproduce old error (endless login-password request). My friend had this error before latest security-misc updates, then he uninstalled Mint and installed MX KDE. Cinnamon works with Kicksecure without bugs now.<br>
Now we just have to wait for the SDDM problems to be fixed.</p>
<p>I think this topic can be rename - for example, “Kicksecure and LMDE, MX KDE and Sparky KDE / SDDM Problems”. So that users can find it in search.</p> ]]></description>

        <title>Enhanced heuristics for determining the swap file size in swap-file-creator?</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@arraybolt3]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>I realize now after reading the code that I shouldn’t have assumed my particular Kicksecure installation had all of the latest changes. I see now that the reason I ended up with a 45 GB or so swapfile was because hibernation was being taken into account, whereas the most recent code in Git appears to have hibernation not taken into account unless explicitly configured otherwise. I didn’t realize I was working on outdated packages, though I see it now.</p>
<p>Looking at the heuristics, I think the only change I want to make outside of general code quality improvements is that I’d like to cap the swapfile size to no more than 10% of the size of the disk. That way if someone boots up a powerful machine from a tiny drive like I did, the swapfile doesn’t end up taking too much space, and it doesn’t end up not being created at all. I’ll implement that.</p> ]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>So, I tested upstream SDDM and found that it did <em>not</em> have a problem with logging in even with the information messages from security-misc. I then stared at the code for a while and couldn’t figure out what changed to make things work, so I bisected the code instead and found the patch that fixes the issue. I then tested it against Debian’s version of SDDM, and sure enough, it works. So I’m going to get a bug reported and try to get a fix “in flight”.</p> ]]></description>

        <title>CPU off-line on Kicksecure</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@arraybolt3]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>The feature you’re referencing is called “hyperthreading”. In essence, your CPU chip has 16 actual CPUs on it, but each one of those is “pretending” to be two CPUs. This allows more efficient utilization of the CPUs, but also opens up the possibility for data to leak between two unrelated processes that happen to be running on the same CPU at the same time. This has resulted in many real-world vulnerabilities, collectively known as “Microarchitectural Data Sampling” (or “MDS” for short). See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microarchitectural_Data_Sampling" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Microarchitectural Data Sampling - Wikipedia</a>. Kicksecure intentionally disables hyperthreading for this reason, using a kernel boot parameter.</p>
<p>If you must, you <em>can</em> re-enable hyperthreading, but it’s not recommended. Run <code>sudo nano /etc/default/grub.d/40_cpu_mitigations.cfg</code>, then find all instances of <code>nosmt</code> in this file and remove them (you may have to remove some commas too, and there’s at least one instance of <code>nosmt=force</code> that will need removed entirely). Be careful to not break your system when doing this, you should NOT do this unless you know what you’re doing with editing GRUB configuration. Once you have edited the file, save your changes and then reboot. This should enable all 32 threads on the CPU.</p> ]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>Hello, I wanted to create a VM on virt-manager but I noticed that it offers me 16 cpu instead of 32 because I have 2 processors of 16 threads. After some research I saw that kicksecure had indeed found 32 threads but that half of them are disabled, so I tried to enable them manually by going through the sys folder but I have no right to modify the /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/online file. How can I fix this? Thanks in advance</p> ]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>I just finished installing Debian 12 onto a USB flash drive, then distro-morphing it to Kicksecure on my primary development laptop. The laptop has 32 GB RAM, while the flash drive is about 128 GB. I noticed swap-file-creator report it was creating a swapfile that was around 45 GB in size. I can see how this probably happened (I’m guessing it’s making a file equal to RAM size plus 50%), but two things come to mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating a 45GB swap file is almost certainly overkill.</li>
<li>Creating a swapfile that takes up over 35% of available disk space is almost certainly overkill.</li>
</ul>
<p>By default, Debian chose to give me a swap partition that was only 1 GB in size, which seems much more reasonable for systems that have lots of RAM like mine. Then again, for someone with very little RAM, 1 GB of swap probably doesn’t make much sense and creating a swapfile equal to 1.5x RAM size would be helpful.</p>
<p>Should we change the algorithm used for determining swap file size? Perhaps 1.5x RAM is fine in general, but we should cap the maximum size to 8 GB or so. Taking into account the size of the storage device would probably also be a good idea.</p> ]]></description>

        <title>Kicksecure and LMDE, MX KDE and Sparky KDE / SDDM Problems</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@arraybolt3]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>Back from testing sleep, seems to work fine here, and KDE’s lock screen copes just fine with the lockout warnings from security-misc, so this is probably hardware-dependent. Also, this might not be a bug in SDDM itself, but might be a problem with Plasma’s SDDM theme. Edit: Looks like it’s a problem in SDDM itself. I’ve tried three different SDDM themes and they all break the same way.</p>
<p>Edit 2: More debugging underway. So far I’ve concluded:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is not a socket read failure within SDDM, or if it is, my workarounds didn’t work.</li>
<li>It definitely <em>is</em> a problem within SDDM, I can see valuable info about the issue in the journalctl logs and it isn’t theme-dependent.</li>
<li>I currently think SDDM is, for some unknown reason, failing to ever hand the password to PAM. It gets the user account handed over, it reads the warning about the risk of a lockout, and then it doesn’t seem to write the password (or if it does, it’s not finalizing <em>something</em> AFAICT). I think this because I can see SDDM is getting the lockout warning in the logs, but the lockout counter still only indicates one failed login even after trying to login with a bad password <em>twice</em>. So that’s probably where I’ll hunt for issues next.</li>
</ul>
<p>I did check the upstream SDDM bugtracker to see if this was a known issue, and didn’t see anything about it. I should try to reproduce the issue with an updated version of SDDM, and try to come up with a minimal reproducible example.</p> ]]></description>

        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@arraybolt3]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>Alright, I didn’t manage to test the sleep mode stuff yet, but I managed to get SDDM to hang reliably. If you always type your password correctly, it works, but if you type your password wrong once, it will make SDDM hang every time you try to enter a password thereafter, regardless of whether that password is correct or not. The quickest way to fix it is to log in at a TTY, then immediately <code>exit</code> and then try logging in at SDDM again.</p>
<p>Can you test the following for me and see if it works to fix the issue?</p>
<ul>
<li>Reinstall security-misc (<code>sudo apt install security-misc</code>)</li>
<li>Run <code>sudo nano /etc/pam.d/common-auth</code></li>
<li>Comment out this line of the file (it should be the first line in the file that isn’t already a comment):</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">auth    optional        pam_exec.so debug stdout seteuid /usr/libexec/security-misc/pam-info
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Press <kbd>Ctrl+S</kbd> to save, then <kbd>Ctrl+X</kbd> to close the file</li>
<li>Log out of KDE Plasma</li>
<li>Type a wrong password at the SDDM screen, wait for it to be rejected</li>
<li>Type <em>another</em> wrong password, this also should be rejected</li>
<li>Now type the right password, it should be accepted</li>
</ul>
<p>If this works on your end, then at least part of the problem has been found - SDDM can’t handle the warning in Kicksecure about how many more times you can fail to enter the correct password before you’re locked out. If this is the case, it’s a bug in SDDM that will require some research to fix.</p>
<p>Going to test sleep and resume now, I should have tested that while I was still booted into Kicksecure but I forgot to.</p> ]]></description>

<p>We should make sure this doesn’t break Recovery Mode, that’s the only thing wrong I can think of with that.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Actually i would argue against that, why do we need to rely on recovery mode?</p>
<p>I think of recovery mode ability is like backdooring your own OS, what we need to do is that change the mentality of how user reacting with OS:</p>
<p>Since we are moving towards btrfs/snapshot feature this will reduce the reliability on recovery mode.</p>
<p>Other thing is that think about a mobile phone got whatever issue to the boot of the OS, yes it has recovery mode but very unlikely users gonna figure out how to use it let alone if its even possible to have any usefulness when entering recovery mode as it will just allow you to reinstall the OS…</p>
<p>So how to solve this? another mental change to the user that he should always backup his own data to his own hardware and that can be his own flash/hard drive, or internal clould (NAS/Nexcloud…etc) or even external server… something he choose but the OS will not backdoor itself for recovery mode.</p>
<p>Note: booting into recovery mode is a malicious boot up of the system, because it will be booting with minimalistic services meaning will disable almost all security features that user needs, other word its just the wrong method in nowadays time.</p> ]]></description>

<p>They sabotaged security efforts [1]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[1] exact link/reference + exact quotation</p>

<p>Otherwise, one first need to ask for clarification what this is even about.</p>

<p>and the efforts to do that were stalled and then rolled back when the person responsible for most of it left the project.</p>

<p>If this is about <a href="https://github.com/madaidan" class="inline-onebox">madaidan · GitHub</a>, then it can be seen that madaidan’s github activity completely ceased in 2022, not only related to Kicksecure/Whonix.</p>

        <title>GrapheneOS Attacks Kicksecure! What should the response be?</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@privacy]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <blockquote>
<p>Kicksecure is awful. Has a horrible choice of base OS for security and they don’t do valuable work to improve it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Who is they?</p>
<p>You mean not very many people are contributing enough or working on Kicksecure is what that translates to?<br>
The claim that Kicksecure “doesn’t do valuable work to improve it” overlooks the contributions made by the project in terms of privacy and security enhancements. Kicksecure integrates various security features and tools that are designed to protect user anonymity and data, which can be valuable in the context of its intended use.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They sabotaged security efforts and are spreading misinformation about allocator hardening and other topics they don’t understand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The understanding I have is it breaking Xorg and both Whonix/Kicksecure use Xfce. Again who is they who is sabotaging security efforts, do they mean more like little to no people working on it compared to GrapheneOS?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Secureblue is doing useful work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ok, some of those things look like they could be ported or looked at on Kicksecure/Whonix but take in mind this Secureblue is a Fedora project.</p>
<p>Kicksecure strives to be hardened Debian or rather what Debian out of the box should be. If you have ever manually hardened your Debian installs you understand how valuable Kicksecure or rather the repository is.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Someone making an equivalent out of Fedora Silverblue or Arch would obsolete it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again the focus on the base system is Debian.<br>
This is not a Fedora based distro or Arch.</p>
<p>Silverblue uses two things for containerization Podman and Flatpak, but primarily uses Podman for containerization. Podman may be something for Kicksecure/Whonix to look into, but in regards to Flatpak I’m someone who will always avoid it because I think Flatpak is utter trash.</p>
<p>Silverblue and Android both use SELinux. SELinux is more complex then AppArmor but might be better but requires lots of configuration and policy management. Take in mind another Privacy/Security distro Tails doesn’t use SELinux but rather AppArmor instead.</p>
<p>Also as stated by Daniel Micay:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>AppArmor is extremely limited in what it can do compared to SELinux. Ubuntu integrated of App Armor and the Fedora and RHEL integration of SELinux barely does anything though. That’s not particularly serious SELinux integration and barely does anything for a desktop setup at all.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Presumably, you all disagree with Daniel Micay / GrapheneOS. What is the rebuttal here?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Well I will say this Daniel Micay always has always acted like everyone is out to get him.<br>
Unlike Daniel Micay, the main dev that maintains Whonix/Kicksecure <a class="mention" href="https://forums.kicksecure.com/u/patrick">@Patrick</a> is the one holding up the project isn’t attacking others and acting like everyone is out to get them.<br>
It’s important to recognize the challenges that come with being the primary maintainer of a project. Burnout can be a real issue for those who are responsible for testing and developing software, and this can impact the pace of progress. Patrick’s ability to navigate these challenges while fostering a positive environment speaks to his character and dedication to the project. I have never felt anything other then a  toxic or rather elitist feeling then when I have talked to those in the GrapheneOS space, I don’t feel that reflects their developers, but rather their community. I don’t get that feeling in the Kicksecure/Whonix community.</p>
<p>The only thing I guess I could agree with him on is his/her’s tweet is mention of Wayland and I think a top priority of Kicksecure/Whonix would be swiching to Wayland and a different Desktop Environment instead of Xfce. As it currently stands Xfce doesn’t have Wayland support. I don’t know how Hardened Malloc works with Wayland but once the switch then it could be ported. Whonix workstation and Kicksecure could be better but this involves research/testing and you know like more people contributing, which Daniel fails to mention.</p> ]]></description>

        <title>PureVPN does not work after installing Kicksecure</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@linuxer]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>All apps work - telegram, whatsapp, signal, browser (except tor without tor). As soon as you uninstall kicksecure and pure vpn instantly connects to servers. That’s why I am asking which kicksecure package can affect internet? You can install tor in kicksecure, then disable tor network: network.dns.disabled ⇒ false extensions.torlauncher.start_tor ⇒ false network.proxy.socks ⇒ _ and this browser won’t work, but it work in default debian-ubuntu. If you can launch this browser, it will launch a pure vpn. I knew for sure that security-misk, tirdad, sdwdate packages were definitely not related to this problem</p> ]]></description>

<p>I should have been more clear - I’m trying to find out if DNS is working for other apps or not. It sounds like it probably is, but just so we can be completely sure, can you share the output of <code>dig kicksecure.com</code>?</p>
<p>Finally, other users of PureVPN have noticed “connection timed out” errors that didn’t have anything to do with DNS.

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>To begin with, I’d recommend running <code>sudo apt install --no-install-recommends kicksecure-cli-host</code> to put back at least most of the packages you’ve tried removing. Without knowing what you removed, it’s hard to know whether you’ve potentially weakened the system’s security or not.</p>
<p>Next, the DNS stuff. Right now I’m not totally sure that DNS is actually the problem, and if it is, it’s unclear what’s wrong with it, so I need to ask you for some more information.</p>
<ul>
<li>Can you share the contents of your <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> file? This file indicates what DNS server the system is using. I <em>do</em> need to see the IP addresses in this file, since they tell me what DNS servers the system is configured to use. Unless your network is very badly misconfigured, or you’re hosting your own public DNS server in your house, those IP addresses won’t be usable to locate or identify you, and thus should be safe to share publicly. You can look up any IP addresses you see to make extra sure.</li>
<li>Is the computer able to connect to websites without a VPN?</li>
<li>What is the output of <code>dpkg-query -s systemd-resolved</code>?</li>
<li>Does “pure-vpn” have logs you can share that could help us understand what’s wrong a little bit better?</li>
</ul>
<p>I have an idea for a fix, but let’s start with that and see where things go from there.</p> ]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>As far as I can tell, this has no bearing on Kicksecure whatsoever.</p>
<p>External community drama is not a distro problem, it’s that simple. People are entitled to their own opinions about software applications, and are welcome to share those opinions with others. I do it, my friends do it, you’ve probably done it, and I have no issue with someone at GrapheneOS doing it too.
