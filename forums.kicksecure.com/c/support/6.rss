            <p>hi. my girlfriend installed morphing kicksecure on debian xfce and her pure-vpn stopped working - can’t connect to server. it looks like these are problems due to dns changes. how to return default dns settings or what package to delete so that kicksecure doesn’t interfere with dns? i tried to delete several packages, but to no avail. only timeshift solves problem - a return to default debian. i use nordvpn and mullvad - there is no such problem.</p>

            <p>Downloaded and verified Debian bookworm ISO.<br>
dd if=offed it to a usb stick.<br>
Installed Debian xfce to my laptops 80GB ssd.<br>
Distromorphed Kicksecure following these instructions:</p>
<p>trafotin com v kicksecure</p>
<p>When starting first time to the desktop the Disks application says 24GB used?</p>
<p>This cant be normal. Could some kicksecures memory security features cause this?</p>
<p>Sidenotes:<br>
-Installed tor browser bundle, which has now started suggesting browsing history in address bar after starting tor browser. (Computer was powered on just prior to starting tor browser.) All browsing history settings are off and tor browser default settings should prevent any browsing history carry on from previous instanses. Just mentioning this if it is related to other funnybusiness. Posting this to tor forum also. Search about it gave very little.</p>
<p>-Is it ok to install OpenSnitch on Kicksecure. Would like to see who is calling where. I have been using it as a comforting passifier or excuse, for years for not delving deeper into firewall and ip-taples cringe.</p>
<p>-CD/DVD wont play. VLC player gives error message:</p>
<p>-There was no calculator in applications? Installed Gnome Calculator myself.</p>
<p>Otherwise all is sweet so far.</p>
<p>Thank you for all the great work and effort you have put into this.</p>

            <p>HI all,<br>
I realise morphing Linux Mint Debian edition to Kicksecure is unsupported, but I’m interested in learning from the experience of anyone who has done this. One thing I’m wondering is how updates will work after morphing. Will I continue to get updates from Linux Mint? Are there any big problems you’ve encountered?<br>
Thanks</p>
<p>Edit:<br>
Hi Patrick,<br>
Thanks for replying. Yes, I’m aware of those links/options. That’s why I specifically stated I know it’s unsupported. I was hoping for some feedback and discussion from other users, not support from the team.</p>
<p>If such discussions are not allowed here, can you direct me to somewhere they are allowed?</p>
<p>I’ve searched and there are very few discussions of Kicksecure + Linux Mint elsewhere on the web. I’m not surprised as it’s increasingly difficult to ask questions anywhere these days.</p>
<p>I’ve asked a similar question on the Linux Mint forums and they also closed the topic, saying it wasnt relevant to Mint and I should ask the question on Kicksecure forums. The rules for posting on Reddit forums are labyrinthine and arbitrary at the same time.</p>
<p>So, if such a discussion can’t be allowed here either, where are Kicksecure users supposed to learn from each other? Please consider reopening this topic or else consider adding a forum section where users are able to discuss things among themselves without expecting involvement from the Kicksecure team. This would be another valuable learning resource.<br>
Regards</p>

          <title>How to stop writing my ISO&#39;s as Rock Ridge/Joliet</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[z24]]></dc:creator>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Edit: I may have included too much additional information, I tried to provide enough data so others that have experienced this or may experience it in the future are able to locate this thread through search engines and hopefully get a resolution the issue.</p>
<p>This gets called anytime I download an ISO and I can’t figure out how to make it stop. Its able to replace the freshly downloaded ISO with the Rock Ridge version instantaneously before I could even run a dd command or launch disk image writer to get the fresh ISO written to disk before it is modified.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>xorriso -as mkisofs -R -r -J -joliet-long -l -cache-inodes -iso-level 3 --grub2-boot-info --grub2-mbr /usr/lib/grub/i386-pc/boot_hybrid.img -efi-boot-part --efi-boot-image -v -A “application_id” -p “preparer” -publisher “publisher” -V “cdlabel” --modification-date=20240XXXXXXXX -no-emul-boot -boot-load-size 4 -boot-info-table -b boot/grub/grub_eltorito -eltorito-alt-boot -e boot/grub/efi.img -no-emul-boot -isohybrid-gpt-basdat -isohybrid-apm-hfsplus -o /home/user/derivative-binary/17.2.3.7/Kicksecure-Xfce-17.2.3.7.iso /home/user/derivative-binary/Kicksecure-Xfce_iso-tmp</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don’t think I’m on the real Kicksecure anymore. A lot of things that shouldn’t be enabled by default are enabled like the bluetooth.service, overlayfs, fuse, and ntfs3g are also enabled. My xdg-user-dirs is normally /home/user/.config I think, it has been changed to point to /usr/bin/share/, that way I load flatpaks from the wrong directory just like the flatpak escape 0day did.</p>
<p>The doocumentation (man pages for example) aren’t even the same and my grub menu shows that lines have been removed, there is a new line added that is a if fi statement to insert two more kernel modules named lzopio and xen (I think that’s the name of them, very close if not). It seems like the lower deck of the overlayfs  is hooking into upper deck with some malicious binaries and shared objects, deleting anything hooked into the upper deck causes a crash, the lower deck is all lib32 software running on a squashfs.img and its dependencies get mangled in with my own, I have to download SSH libs for apps that don’t require networking to function or other random packages that should not be dependencies. I also have to delete the boot order using efitbootmgr and modify my grub entry in order to actually boot into the system at the lower deck. Even figuring out how to boot into the lower deck of the system doesn’t solve the problem though unfortunately.</p>
<p>It’s not as simple as reformatting my USB drive and secure erasing my SSD then using a fresh ISO, it’s like the data doesn’t really get wiped from the USB even though it appears that way to software like gparted and gnome-disks reading the disk image. I have wiped it then brought it over to a remote location, away from my potentially infected machine and it still manages to write that same ISO with the overlayfs and Rock Ridge ISO.</p>
<p>So, what I’m trying to get at as is, has anyone dealt with this before? What can I do aside from considering my devices trashed? I’m strongly considering dumping this data publicly out of frustration but something doesn’t feel right about doing that, somebody certainly put a lot of time and effort into devoping and writing documentation for this system.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the man pages and python documentation are not standard, almost all of the binaries serve an alternate purpose than their name would lead you to believe, for example I can run ‘gpic FILENAME &gt; OUTPUT.txt’ and deobfuscate data hidden inside of files. There is a man page for GNUstep (if I recall correctly) that’s as long as novel and it goes into detail about how to write code in order to cause a buffer overflow in the kernel. So sharing something like that publicly seems to me like I would be destroying the hard work of someone or some group of individuals who have put a lot of time into it. As much I hate what they did to me, I’m also in awe of their work and complexity of the system at the same time.</p>
<p>Is this a known thing that others are getting attacked with in the wild, is it more likely a targeted attack and not wide spread? Locally it seems to spread like a worm via usb and through the network, the boot loader they force me to boot from contains a kernel for Windows, Mac, and Linux (version 5.1, unsupported and out of date), so even switching operating systems does not solve the problem. I hope someone can provide a solution that doesn’t involve throwing my machine into the dump.</p>

<p>I am setting up SMB or wanting to. Now I have a GLinet Flint 2 router and it seems very basic to setup but I am running into issues. Is there something to install on either the router or in KickSecure? I thought this would be a easy setup.</p>

          <title>Swap-file-creator missing when in Qubes templates (morphing &amp; official derivative templates)</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[Crok]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Support</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I’ve been using Kicksecure and it’s derivatives for a good while by now in Qubes VMs and on servers (Kicksecure in Qubes and on server is morphed, Whonix 17 templates are official Qubes templates) and just realized that I have a seemingly plain, unencrypted swap partition on all Qubes templates. The morphed version on the server host looks correct, if I am not mistaken. Reading the documentation, my impression is that  <code>swap-file-creator</code> should change this by default on Kicksecure systems.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>

/etc/fstab entry in morphed Debian template on Qubes OS <a href="https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/swap-file-creator-missing-when-in-qubes-templates-morphing-official-derivative-templates/644/1">(click for more details)</a>

/etc/fstab entry in my Whonix-Workstation AppVM installed from the official template on Qubes OS <a href="https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/swap-file-creator-missing-when-in-qubes-templates-morphing-official-derivative-templates/644/1">(click for more details)</a>

Several command outputs from my morphed Kicksecure on a virtual server <a href="https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/swap-file-creator-missing-when-in-qubes-templates-morphing-official-derivative-templates/644/1">(click for more details)</a>
<p>The package is also not installed on any of the machines except for the morphed host (actually a VPS). It looks like I chose <code>kicksecure-qubes-cli</code> for the Kicksecure template on Qubes while morphing and, again, the Whonix templates were not built by myself. On the VPS, I chose <code>kicksecure-cli-host</code>. (Writing this… is there potentially a difference between the <code>host</code> and the <code>qubes</code> packages in regards to the package being installed/not installed?)</p>
<p>Trying to find an answer to this still left me with two related questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the documentation outdated? It states that it should be installed by default: /wiki/Swap-file-creator#Installation (posting the link resulted in an error, sorry)<br>
That said, I don’t know what cases <em><strong>“otherwise”</strong></em> covers or what history, intention or background the sentence has, though.</li>
<li>Is there any other countermeasure against potentially sensitive information being written to the disk via swapping, which I was not able to find in the wiki, or may, for instance, keys have ended up on my disk?</li>
</ul>

          <title>Are Tor hidden services on Kicksecure safe against entry-guard attacks?</title>

          <category>Support</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hi, I am making this topic because I am curious about the current safety status of using Kicksecure to run a Tor hidden service under default configurations, and what mitigations against entry-guard attacks are currently recommended and supported, if any.</p>
<p>I understand that Tor itself is baked-in with Vanguards Lite, but unless I am misunderstanding the documentation, this is not appropriate for a hidden service that is intended to be active for more than one month. (I would provide this documentation for review, but the board will not let me post a link).</p>
<p>From searches on the Whonix forums, I have seen it suggested to downgrade Tor and then re-enable Vanguards? (Again, I can’t include the link to this…)</p>
<p>Is this correct, and are there any special requirements for re-enabling Vanguards or does it simply need to be installed and enabled via systemctl?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hello. My friends from all over the world write that they have problems with Kicksecure installation when choosing a locale language layout. Only default installation in english ends well. If a different language is selected, then an error on 77% of installation:</p>

          <title>Impossible to start Evolution app since the last update</title>

            <p>Hello,<br>
Since the last Kicksecure update, I can no longer launch Evolution, the messaging application. It’s set as the default application, but it won’t start either with a graphical command or from the command line.<br>
When I try to launch it from the command line, I get the following messages, which are totally incomprehensible to me.<br>
Thank you for your help!</p>

            <p>I also do have this issue even without running kicksecure fom ventoy!<br>
I installed kicksecure onto usb flash drive following word for word the official installation tutorial to install kicksecure iso to usb flash drive. Booting after installation works, but afterwards I shutdown, unplugged the flash drive and booted the linux host on the hardware, kicksecure boots only to grub bash line.</p>
