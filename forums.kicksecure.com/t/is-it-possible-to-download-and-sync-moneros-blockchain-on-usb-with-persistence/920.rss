    <title>Is it possible to download and sync monero&#39;s blockchain on usb with persistence?</title>
    <link>https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/is-it-possible-to-download-and-sync-moneros-blockchain-on-usb-with-persistence/920</link>
    <description>I want to follow this tutorial:
monero (dot) how/tutorial-how-to-speed-up-initial-blockchain-sync
So i can download the blockchain over clearnet and import it into a monero client running on whonix VM and sync it there

However due to the fact that i want the kicksecure to be on a flashdrive i dont know how this should work.
Should I try to download the blockchain on a hard drive then copy it on a flashdrive and copy it on the kicksecure flashdrive running in persistence mode?

Or would it possible to run the kicksecure flash in persistence, download the blockchain there, copy it into the whoniX VM and then sync it?</description>
