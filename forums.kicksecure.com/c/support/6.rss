          <title>Include whonix installer with Kicksecure Live ISO?</title>

            <p>Would it be possible to include the Whonix gateway and workstation with the Live ISO?<br>
Currently the Live ISO size is only 1.3 GB and is pretty bare and leaves alot of room for much more.</p>
<p>Most USB’s are 16GB and up and most physical CD/DVD’s are 4.5 or 8.5GB.<br>
The sad thing there is no Live distros that come with Virtual Machine software that you can use live or are not maintained anymore.</p>
<p>It would be great if the Live ISO came with whonix gateway &amp; workstation and VM’s software. So not only would Kicksecure ISO have an installer it would also serve utility of being a Live USB that has whonix and virtualization software included.</p>

            <p>So I downloaded the Kicksecure Xfce ISO, verified it and verified it after flashing to USB.<br>
When booting up the USB there is no <em>“LIVE mode USER (for daily activies.)”</em> option in GRUB.</p>
<p>Why is there not Live Mode included in the Kicksecure Live ISO and Installer?</p>

          <title>Ethernet Network Wired connection not working after fresh install</title>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hi. Sorry, I am very beginner to Linux OS, but I have spent 6 hours today and was not able to figure this out.</p>
<p><strong>Some INFO:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>So, I installed Kicksecure from Kicksecure ISO following this guide kicksecure . com/wiki/ISO and pressed “Install to hardrive” and installed it to my SSD. During installation my internet cable from my home router was plugged in (dunno if that matters)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is the problem?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>After installation finished, I booted the Kicksecure OS and everything seem to work, except my internet from my Ethernet cable.<br>
Note: I tried plugging a wireless card and the internet would instantly work via WIFI (after plugging i did apt-get update &amp;&amp; upgrade). Also, on other OS on same PC, my internet through cable would work instantly. I guess that it is something with Kicksecure settings that is not working for me.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I do?</strong><br>
Well since I am a noob I was searching and trying different suggested ideas, mainly from Debian 12 (bookworm).</p>
<ul>
<li>First thing i noticed I did not have /etc/network/interfaces so I tried creating that with different settings like:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

auto eth0
allow-hotplug eth0
iface eth0 inet dhcp
</code></pre>
<p>that only made my “Ethernet: wired connection 1” disappear in my nm-connection-editor. So, I removed that and started searching again.Then I read all of this forums.whonix . org/t/kicksecure-network-configuration/8985/52 and my head started to hurt. But what i understood (and maybe that is wrong) that network on Kicksecure is configured in their own unique way, not like Debian 12 /etc/network/interfaces. That realization did not help me much tho. I then noticed my connection did not have any IPv4, only IPv6. So I tried manually imagining what my IP could look like if it was static, since usually everything is DHCP. So I tried adding in my NetworkManager Applet</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">IP Address: 192.168.1.15
Netmask: 255.255.255.0
Gateway: 192.168.1.254
DNS servers: 192.168.1.254 (also tried 8.8.8.8)
</code></pre>
<p>All that did was - that instead of <code>ping 8.8.8.8 Network unreachable </code> I started getting</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">PING 8.8.8.8 (8.8.8.8) 58 (84) bytes of data.
From 192.168.1.15 icmp_seq=1 Destination Host Unreachable
</code></pre>
<p>Which as you can probably now tell was a progress for me. Anyway, but I am kinda stuck here and don’t know what to do. Here is how my ifconfig -a  looks like:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">[user ~]% ifconfig -a 
eth0: flags=4163&lt;UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST&gt;  mtu 1500

        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0
</code></pre>
<p>Also I dont understand how to restart my network in Kicksecure, I tried:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">sudo systemctl restart networking
sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart
/usr/bin/systemctl restart networking
sudo service networking restart
</code></pre>
<p>but nothing seems to worked, so I had to reboot my OS after yet another “new brilliant idea” that i had <img src="https://forums.kicksecure.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"> that what hell looks like xD especially with Luks encryption -.-</p>

          <title>Ansible task for Kicksecure increasing attack surface?</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[Harisfromcyber]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Support</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I recently took an interest in moving to a hardened debian-based distro and Kicksecure felt like the best option for me. I wanted to automate the installation of it by creating an Ansible task for it that can make it easy to install, as I have a playbook for Debian. Here are the bash commands I use around the playbook:</p>
<pre data-code-wrap="bash"><code class="lang-bash"># Add /sbin to path to for user include its binaries in command line
export PATH=/sbin:$PATH
# User does not have sudo access, so switch to root
su root #`su` could be used, as it assumes root by default
# Adduser to sudo group
adduser user sudo
# Manually add user to sudo group (sudoers) by adding them under root and copying the same permissions as root
## Required since just adding user to sudo group doesn't seem to give user sudo command access
sudo visudo 
# Exit from root
exit
# Install git and Ansible
sudo apt install git ansible -y
# Download the repository
git clone [repo_here]
# Change Directory into the repo
cd ansible
# Install Roles from Ansible Galaxy
ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml
# Run the playbook
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini Debian.yml -K 
#Reboot to finalize changes
reboot
</code></pre>
<p>By doing the setup with the commands above, am I increasing the attack surface since I am not doing it exactly how it is written on the Debian+Kicksecure steps? After install, other than being asked to remove “gnome-calculator”, I seem to be passing the systemcheck. I do understand that Debian-morphed-to-Kicksecure steps are there for a reason, and this is a niche support request. However, if there is no issue doing it this way, I would like to either submit this to documentation and/or just make it public for anyone to use.</p>
<p>P.S. Ansible task for context:</p>
<pre data-code-wrap="YAML"><code class="lang-YAML">---

            <p>So the way I installed Kicksecure was without granting root rights to user to lock it down better.<br>
How can I make it so user can still do upgrade-nonroot without adding user to the sudo group?</p>
<p>Would changing the permissions to the <code>upgrade-nonroot</code> and <code>apt-get-update-plus</code> achieve this?</p>
<p><code>chmod 755 /usr/bin/upgrade-nonroot</code></p>
<p><code>chmod 755 /usr/bin/apt-get-update-plus</code></p>
<p>Would this be a stupid idea? (just want to be able to use user to update/upgrade not install packages)</p>

            <p>I’m new to this and I’m a bit confused about the differences between Kicksecure and Debian. Can someone please explain this to me and suggest some resources where I can learn more about it?</p>
<p>Additionally, if any forum members have recommendations on where to find more information on how Kicksecure sources.list work, please share them with me. I understand that Kicksecure is designed to enhance the security of Debian.</p>
<p>I had some issues, where fixed by reading over the install guide again.</p>

            <p>Trying to apply kicksecure’s hardenings to Parrot Home edition (Vbox), but i ran into some problems. Here is the output:<br>
sudo apt install --no-install-recommends kicksecure-cli-vm<br>
Reading package lists… Done<br>
Building dependency tree… Done<br>
Reading state information… Done<br>
Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have<br>
requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable<br>
distribution that some required packages have not yet been created<br>
or been moved out of Incoming.<br>
The following information may help to resolve the situation:</p>
<p>The following packages have unmet dependencies:<br>
kicksecure-recommended-cli : Depends: libblockdev-crypto2 but it is not installable<br>
plymouth : Conflicts: console-common but 0.7.91 is to be installed<br>
: Error, pkgProblemResolver::Resolve generated breaks, this may be caused by held packages.</p>
<p>Already tried and searched for many solutions, but none of them really solved my problem. Someone can help me?</p>

            <p>on a debian 12 install, I configured NFS for use on my local LAN. I did intsall network-manager-gnome and openvpn…</p>
<p>after my client was able to mount the remote (local LAN). after installing kicksecure, I cannot get them to connect.</p>
<p>connection timeout when trying to mount from the command line.</p>
<p>I have double shecked hosts.allow and exports on the server, but they didnt seem to have been altered by installing kicksecure.</p>
<p>I DO have multiple NIC installed (4). 2 in use to WAN via router1, and 1 in use to router2 (local LAN)</p>
<p>portlist shows tcp 2049<br>
rpcinfo shows<br>
portmapper ports 111 TCP &amp; UDP for versions 2,3,4<br>
nfs ports 2049 TCP versions 3 &amp; 4, and a nfs_acl on 2049 for version 3</p>
<p>ideally i would prefer to have an IP or MAC verified w/o kerberos, but I will take what I can at the moment I cant get mount working…</p>

            <p>Please help me solve the problem</p>
<p>Clean installation of Debian 12 standard - subsequent distro-morphing in Kicksecure-XFCE exactly according to the instructions<br>
The Live mode menu does not appear</p>
<p>checking the installation:</p>

<p>when I trying <code>sudo apt install --no-install-recommends dracut</code> and then<code> sudo update-grub</code>, a menu appears but the system does not boot</p>
<p>My goal is just to get a working Kicksecure system on a USB flash drive with LIVE mode</p>
<p>Please tell me the easiest way to get such a system</p>
