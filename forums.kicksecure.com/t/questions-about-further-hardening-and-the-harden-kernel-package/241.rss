    <title>Questions about Further Hardening and the Harden Kernel Package</title>
    <link>https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/questions-about-further-hardening-and-the-harden-kernel-package/241</link>
    <description>Greetings, 

I am an individual seeking to further harden the security of their laptop.  

I found this guide on `ansible`: https://bobcares.com/blog/ansible-cis-hardening-debian/

I wanted to know if ansible is incompatible with the Kicksecure project. 

What if I don&#39;t care about all the warnings on the wiki concerning the hardened kernel? How could I get the hardened kernel on my system as fast as possible? Should I download the source from kernel.org and patch the kernel myself? Or is installing the `hardened-kernel` package sufficient? Does it do the thing regardless of the current limitations of the project? 

https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Hardened-kernel#linux-hardened

Also I used an auditing tool called `lynis` on a fresh Debian install. The score was 60 for Debian, but after distro morphing to kick secure the score was 67! That&#39;s pretty impressive to me. 

Thank you for all your hard work. Do support recurring donations?</description>
