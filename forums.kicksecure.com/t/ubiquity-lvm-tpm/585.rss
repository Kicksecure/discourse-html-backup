It has advantages on what calamares provide: 

- [Support LVM](https://canonical-subiquity.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/reference/autoinstall-reference.html#supported-layouts) which [calamares lack](https://github.com/calamares/calamares/issues/2343).
- [Support TPM-fde](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/subiquity-23-10-1-has-been-released-to-the-stable-channel/39344) installation which [calamares lack](https://github.com/calamares/calamares/issues/2355).</description>

            <p>It‚Äôs super easy to expose BTRFS as an option in the installer. Lubuntu and Kubuntu have both been shipping with ext4, BTRFS, and XFS all available as options on the ‚ÄúPartitions‚Äù screen, no need for manual partitioning. It only requires tweaking one configuration file (IIRC) to make Kicksecure do the same thing.</p>

<p>TPM seems to be on the good luck road.</p>

<p>Did you ever use LVM or are you theorizing? Did you accept my challenge:</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>LVM is the default installation by qubes because it uses anaconda, and debian because it uses d-i (which i use both).</p>
<p>The challenge which you are proposing is a specific use case which i described above for ubiquity bugs, it doesnt provide any critical bug which LVM suffer VS no LVM.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>If you cannot pass the challenge, you‚Äôre not really using LVM except for some transparent use in Qubes but no real user interaction.</p>
<p>Why argue for a feature which you‚Äôre actively making use yourself? Feature completeness?</p>
<p>No, feature completeness based on theoretic considerations is an insufficient argument.</p>
<p>The Linux boot process is complicated enough. (<a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Dev/image_creation" class="inline-onebox">Development of System Image Creation and Bootstrapping Tools</a>)</p>
<p>Stacking another layer of complexity (LVM) without strong rationale is only making a bigger mess on top the existing usability mess. That‚Äôs why I even created <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Broken_Boot" class="inline-onebox">Broken Boot - Kicksecure</a>. Once the boot process is broken, analysis and recovery without re-installation is extremely complicated. The internet is full of of support requests by users which went unresolved.</p>
<p>I think the issue is, that we don‚Äôt have a feature request template for Kicksecure yet. This is what Qubes has:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The problem you‚Äôre addressing (if any)</li>
<li>The solution you‚Äôd like</li>
<li>The value to a user, and who that user might be</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>And this is from systemd:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe
<ul>
<li>A clear and concise description of what the problem is. Ex. I‚Äôm always frustrated when [‚Ä¶]</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Describe the solution you‚Äôd like
<ul>
<li>A clear and concise description of what you want to happen.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Describe alternatives you‚Äôve considered
<ul>
<li>A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you‚Äôve considered.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Please fill this out, describe the feature you‚Äôre <strong>personally</strong> missing.</p>
<p>Because then maybe way to get this feature is indeed LVM but perhaps there are more suitable, simpler alternatives such as btrfs</p>
<p>It might make sense to request features that one doesn‚Äôt personally need but thinks this would be good for the overall health of the project since others those need it don‚Äôt even make a feature request. But in case of LVM, I don‚Äôt think that makes sense.</p>

<p>If it was generic use issue, many would have fallen under the same condition, including marmarek himself. Probably its just unman specific config issue.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>If even unman runs into this issue, doesn‚Äôt know how to fix it and nobody knows it either, then it‚Äôs simply too difficult.</p>
<p>Or take <a href="https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/8707" class="inline-onebox">Unable to boot | "qubes_dom0-root does not exist" | Possible LVM problem ¬∑ Issue #8707 ¬∑ QubesOS/qubes-issues ¬∑ GitHub</a>. After complex analysis, it just stalled. DemiMarie (Qubes developer) didn‚Äôt answer anymore for some reason. That could be running out of ideas or time or something else. But the reasons are speculation since the end result is the same. It‚Äôs too complex, requires too much effort to debug.</p>
<p>Since in case of Kicksecure it‚Äôs optional and doesn‚Äôt have a strong rationale, it‚Äôs best avoided.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs not the kind of reliability, stability and maintainability that I set as project goals. Related:</p>

<p>Originally Ubiquity was replaced in Ubuntu Desktop with a Flutter-based installer. That installer was later converted into a more flexible ‚Äúprovisioning‚Äù system, the details of which can be found at <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/from-installation-to-provisioning-upgrading-the-ubuntu-desktop-installer/42139" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">From installation to provisioning - upgrading the Ubuntu Desktop installer - Desktop - Ubuntu Community Hub</a>, That system is ubuntu-desktop-provision.</p>
<p>Ubiquity was nearly removed from the Ubuntu archives entirely in the 24.04 cycle, but was kept around because it is still used in some edge cases. <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/request-to-not-remove-ubiquity-from-24-04/42882" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Request to not remove Ubiquity from 24.04 - Desktop - Ubuntu Community Hub</a></p>
<p>The Git repo you link to with a commit 5 days ago is for Subiquity, which is a distinct and separate project from Ubiquity. It is used as the backend for ubuntu-desktop-provision and the Ubuntu Server installer.</p>

<p>Subiquity, but otherwise mostly correct. Like I mentioned, Ubuntu Studio used to use Calamares, but no more. I was part of the conversation when the primary dev of Ubuntu Studio decided to switch. Initially <a href="https://ubuntustudio.org/2023/10/ubuntu-studio-23-10-released/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">the switch went from Calamares back to Ubiquity</a>, then from <a href="https://ubuntustudio.org/2024/02/updates-for-february-2024/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Ubiquity to ubuntu-desktop-provision</a>.</p>

<p>Yeah, it is messed up pretty badly. Again though, that could be libkpmcore‚Äôs fault, but that‚Äôs uncertain. Would have to look deeper at the code to find out.</p>

<p>LVM is the default installation by qubes because it uses anaconda, and debian because it uses d-i (which i use both).</p>
<p>The challenge which you are proposing is a specific use case which i described above for ubiquity bugs, it doesnt provide any critical bug which LVM suffer VS no LVM.</p>

<p>We cant just point out that this is crushed and not booting because oh there is LVM mentioned on the screen, real cause need to be identified then decided if its really LVM specific or not.</p>

</aside>
<p>Im not sure how did you come to this conclusion, ubuntu-desktop-provision is for post installation stuff, ubiquity is the one handling partitioning and initial setup (system installer) of ubuntu (or any distro using it).</p>
<p>ubuntu-desktop-provision: For configuring an OEM provisioning flow for Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS, where user creation and account setup is handled seperately to system setup (<a href="https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-desktop-provision?tab=readme-ov-file#24041-oem-provisioning">reference</a>).</p>
<p>Ubiquity just has a <a href="https://github.com/canonical/subiquity">new commit</a> 5 days ago.</p>
<p>Unless there is a genuine referral for ubiquity deprecation, ubiquity still the used system installer.</p>

</aside>
<p>Default or non-default doesn‚Äôt even matter. It doesn‚Äôt change what I said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TPM in context of <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Full_Disk_Encryption">Full Disk Encryption (FDE)</a> is also not a priority at all.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Using full disk encryption with a strong password is more secure than using a TPM. This is elaborated here, <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Full_Disk_Encryption#TPM">Full Disk Encryption, chapter TPM</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this context, it seems hard to add a TPM version because this would be difficult to communicate to the user.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIf you wish to use a less secure password and take your chances using a TPM, choose this option. Otherwise, it would be more secure to use a secure password instead.‚Äù</p>
<p>Under these conditions it doesn‚Äôt seem motivating to develop the TPM support feature.</p>
<p>Note: TPM support probably doesn‚Äôt necessarily need to be part of the installer such as calamares. If a user wants to set it up, they can set it up. The user could either,</p>
<ul>
<li>A) add an additional cryptsetup keyslot that uses the TPM; or</li>
<li>B) replace the cryptsetup password based keyslot with a TPM.</li>
</ul>
<p>So whether calamares adds support for TPM or not doesn‚Äôt prevent the user from making use of a TPM for full disk encryption. TPM setup would be <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Unspecific">unspecific to Kicksecure</a> and could be done as per <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Self_Support_First_Policy" class="inline-onebox">Self Support First Policy for Kicksecure</a>.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Some more detail since just ‚Äúit‚Äôs no longer developed‚Äù may not be a satisfactory answer (after all forks are possible):</p>
<p>There are actually a very sizable number of distros that use Calamares as the default installer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kubuntu</li>
<li>Lubuntu</li>
<li>Ubuntu Unity</li>
<li>KaOS</li>
<li>Fedora Asahi Remix</li>
<li>Debian Live</li>
<li>Xebian</li>
<li>KDE neon</li>
<li>I <em>think</em> Artix Linux?</li>
<li>And of course Kicksecure</li>
<li>Ubuntu Studio previously used it but migrated to ubuntu-desktop-provision</li>
</ul>
<p>So it has quite a bit of usage, and there‚Äôs almost certainly some distros I‚Äôve missed or haven‚Äôt seen yet that use it.</p>
<p>Ubiquity is rather Ubuntu-centric. I have only ever seen it used as the default installer for Ubuntu derivatives (whether those be official flavors like Ubuntu MATE or unofficial spinoffs like Mint, Trisquel, KXStudio, ChaletOS, etc). From having tried to work with its code, it is <em>not</em> fun to work with and those I know who have worked on it professionally were‚Ä¶ less than thrilled. Even before it was finally deprecated it was being called outdated and bitrotten. Given it‚Äôs Ubuntu-centric nature, it may not be something that even <em>can</em> be used on other distros, though granted I haven‚Äôt looked into its internals closely enough to know for sure.</p>
<p>The LVM stuff in Calamares stinks, that is very true. Why, I don‚Äôt exactly know, maybe it‚Äôs because libkpmcore (which Calamares relies on for its partitioning work) is broken? However, I have worked on Calamares‚Äô code upstream and it is very approachable. It‚Äôs mostly written in Qt/C++ which is a relatively friendly environment to work with, and some of it is written in Python which is even more friendly. So if LVM were to become a priority, it‚Äôs something I believe would be possible to fix. TPM-based FDE also is likely doable, depending on how exactly that‚Äôs being done in Ubuntu (though as Patrick mentions use of the TPM has worrying security issues that may make it not worth it or not a priority).</p>

<li>Another thing to take care of is that ‚ÄúOpen bugs‚Äù mean how many bugs are opened in the ticket system, ‚ÄúNew Bugs‚Äù which mean that they are still unfixed bugs (called triaged/untriaged in their ticketing system).</li>
</ul>
<p>Conclusion: Based on the age and usage, this comparison has a neglected/no effect.</p>

<p>Everything has bugs but when it occurs/how much its usable is the question. by checking the bugs they are just uncommon/user specific use cases (4 bugs only).</p>
<p>Calamares on the other hand, their developers are just not well educated on how to implement LVM, to the level one opened a ticket to remove it because its just not working.</p>
<p>This shows the difference on who has better high tech work.</p>

</aside>
<p>Unrelated, as Qubes uses LVM by default (has 9 bugs only).</p>
<p>With server level or highly storage use cases, LVM is like a must to be available for ease and flexible for storage capacity scale (unless ditching server support).</p>

</aside>
<p>The discussion is not about being used as a default method or how much its useful, but as a choice to the user, is it even available or not (specially in comparison to the upstream debian).</p>
<hr>
<p>One last thing i want to mention about Ubiquity, its written in python whereas Calamares written in C++.</p>

<p>In comparison. calamares has ~ 140 at time of writing.</p>
<p>I am not saying that one or the other has more bugs, that this is a useful comparison. This is just to say, that a port form calamares to Ubiquity is justified just because Ubiquity has some nicer features.</p>
<p>This is a hard engineering decision and would require a developer comparing the two. calamares might cause less effort because it‚Äôs used by default by Debian live.</p>

<p>LVM is not a priority at all.</p>
<p>I am reasonably technical person but even for me LVM is too much.</p>
<p>The bug reports against both installers calamares, ubiquity also discourages me to look further into LVM.</p>
<p>Also related, the <a href="https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues?q=lvm+in%3Atitle+">fixed and unfixed list of Qubes LVM related issues</a>.

<p>As a challenge, try to boot from an external disk and then access your Qubes encrypted LVM on your internal hard drive for data recovery process. It‚Äôs possible but very difficult for users.</p>
