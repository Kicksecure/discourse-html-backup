        <title>Harden GRUB bootloader using bootloader password</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@arraybolt3]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>Hmm, I hadn’t thought about this being a Calamares feature request, though I guess that makes sense now that you mention it. I see there’s already an open report that you’ve interacted with at <a href="https://github.com/calamares/calamares/issues/2137" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Allow Calamares to set GRUB password · Issue #2137 · calamares/calamares · GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>Then again, do we <em>want</em> it in Calamares for Kicksecure? We’d be introducing more system state changing bits into the installer, which I know is something we’ve wanted to avoid in the past. It might be better to have a custom tool within the OS that the user can use to set or change the password. Such a tool would be usable in preinstalled VMs as well as newly installed systems.</p>
<p>If we were to use the custom tool solution, I don’t think this is something we could easily upstream somewhere, though it may be worth looking for existing tools that do this. If we want the installer-based solution, then naturally Calamares would be the best place to upstream it.</p> ]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p><a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Protection_Against_Physical_Attacks#How_to_set_a_bootloader_password">How to set a bootloader password</a> has been documented thanks to <a class="mention" href="https://forums.kicksecure.com/u/nurmagoz">@nurmagoz</a>.</p>
<p>If we had a simple script to automate these simple but non-trivial steps, that would be good progress.</p>
<p>Could that be upstreamed somewhere?</p>

<p>I think the only thing I’d really like to add to all of the above is that we document how to make the Dracut recovery console available again. I’ve used it for multiple debugging sessions that would have been rendered impossible or close to impossible without it.</p>

<p>We should be careful with calling it more secure IMO - the bootloader password may be harder to bypass, but the BIOS password is necessary to complicate attacks that involve booting from an external USB drive. They both have their pros and cons, and ideally should be used together.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also, we should consider how whatever tooling we make for setting this password interacts with FDE. A user with high security requirements might use BIOS password, bootloader password, FDE passphrase, and a user account password, preferably all different. Most users with moderate security requirements will get away with just FDE though, and those with lower requirements can use a BIOS + bootloader password and avoid the overhead and potential data loss risk of FDE. Do we want our tool to tell the user “You’re using FDE, you probably don’t need a bootloader password”? If so, should we make some brief in-tool documentation that explains the threat models each configuration might be used to defend against?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Probably yes.</p>
<p>Step 1: Writing good documention explaining all of what we discussed in the wiki on <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Protection_Against_Physical_Attacks" class="inline-onebox">Protection against Physical Attacks</a>.</p>
<p>Step 2: This might be quite difficult to get the usability design right. Perhaps this should be discussed with calamares for wider input?</p> ]]></description>

        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@sam]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>me and my friends used standard morphing installation. i would be grateful if you wrote installation for kde plasma and cinnamon. what commands to enter instead of sudo apt install --no-install-recommends kicksecure-xfce-host. But i also installed separate packages - grub-live, security-misc, tirdad and sdwdate - this also led to login hang. Perhaps there are nuances on the virtual machine, so there are no records of sleep mode and sddm. but i have not yet seen a host system that would not have sddm hang after last security-misc update. in some computers sddm hangs only after an incorrect password. in other computers (and mine) when entering any password. but sleep mode does not hang on my computer and on the computer of one friend, but on two other friends sleep mode always hangs - removing security-misc solved this problem. Even installing only one security-misc package on cde plasma and cinnamon caused freezes. I thought the conflict was only with cde plasma, but recently my friend’s LMDE also froze Lightdm</p>
<p>in old versions of security-misc, these problems were not there. only problem was the wrong password entry in sddm at startup. but sleep mode worked well for everyone. If you install kicksecure xfce morph and remove security-misc, then there are no problems and errors - this has been tested on all the OSes I mentioned</p> ]]></description>

<p>This cant be normal. Could some kicksecures memory security features cause this?</p>
<p>Sidenotes:<br>
-Installed tor browser bundle, which has now started suggesting browsing history in address bar after starting tor browser. (Computer was powered on just prior to starting tor browser.) All browsing history settings are off and tor browser default settings should prevent any browsing history carry on from previous instanses. Just mentioning this if it is related to other funnybusiness. Posting this to tor forum also. Search about it gave very little.</p>
<p>-Is it ok to install OpenSnitch on Kicksecure. Would like to see who is calling where. I have been using it as a comforting passifier or excuse, for years for not delving deeper into firewall and ip-taples cringe.</p>
<p>-CD/DVD wont play. VLC player gives error message:</p>
<p>-There was no calculator in applications? Installed Gnome Calculator myself.</p>
<p>Otherwise all is sweet so far.</p>
<p>Thank you for all the great work and effort you have put into this.</p> ]]></description>

        <title>Kicksecure inside LMDE 5?</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@arraybolt3]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>You’ll have to give more specific steps for how to reproduce this. I’ve just attempted to reproduce the issue using Debian 12 + KDE Plasma, on a UEFI-based virt-manager machine. The exact steps taken are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a new virtual machine, specify that a Debian 12.7.0 netinst ISO should be used</li>
<li>Set RAM to 4 GB, disk space to 20 GB</li>
<li>Check “Customize configuration before installing” on the final screen of the VM creation wizard</li>
<li>Set firmware to UEFI (specifically <code>OVMF_CODE_4M.fd</code>)</li>
<li>Begin installation</li>
<li>Configure as follows:
<ul>
<li>Full Name: <code>User</code></li>
<li>Username: <code>user</code></li>
<li>Disk configuration:
<ul>
<li>Partition 1: EFI System Partition, 300 MB</li>
<li>Partition 2: ext4 mounted at <code>/</code>, use all remaining disk space</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Desktop environment: KDE Plasma</li>
<li>Timezone and locale settings set appropriately</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Once installation is complete, reboot</li>
<li>Carefully follow instructions at <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Debian" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Install Kicksecure inside Debian</a> to morph the distribution into Kicksecure, some notes as to how I followed the instructions:
<ul>
<li>When given the option of using extrepo or manual configuration for initially adding the Kicksecure repository, I chose manual configuration.</li>
<li>Signing key was downloaded using TLS.</li>
<li>“Clearnet Rep.” settings were used for manually configuring the Kicksecure repo.</li>
<li>The Kicksecure metapackage I installed was <code>kicksecure-cli-host</code>, to avoid pulling in XFCE</li>
<li>Before following post-installation steps, I rebooted, tested login via SDDM with both Plasma X11 and Plasma Wayland sessions, confirmed it worked, and confirmed <code>security-misc</code> was installed using <code>dpkg-query -s security-misc</code> (it came back as <code>install ok installed</code>)</li>
<li>In the post-installation steps, I used <code>sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list</code> rather than <code>sudo mv /etc/apt/sources.list ~/</code> for getting rid of the original sources.list file, it contained nothing important</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>With this setup, Kicksecure is installed, <code>security-misc</code> is installed, and SDDM login works just fine, both with Wayland and X11 options. <s>I did not test sleep since this is a virtual machine and getting a virt-manager VM out of sleep can be <em>really hard</em>, but I would expect it to work.</s> EDIT: Just tested sleep too, works without issues, even with <code>security-misc</code> installed.</p>
<p>Some things about your configuration that you may want to double-check that may be the source of some of the issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Did you install <code>kicksecure-cli-host</code> or <code>kicksecure-xfce-host</code>? Doing the latter on a machine with another desktop environment already will end up installing XFCE on the machine, which could conflict with your existing desktop environment in interesting ways.</li>
<li>Is your user account named <code>user</code>? There are some subsystems in Kicksecure that only allow an account named <code>user</code> to take certain actions. It’s possible (though unlikely) that the inability to take those actions with another account could be causing the issue.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ve not yet tested with the Cinnamon desktop, or with Debian derivatives such as Sparky or Mint.</p> ]]></description>

        <title>Harden GRUB bootloader using bootloader password</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@arraybolt3]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>I think I like the idea, especially in combination with disabling “easy” recovery mode and the Dracut recovery console. I think the only thing I’d really like to add to all of the above is that we document how to make the Dracut recovery console available again. I’ve used it for multiple debugging sessions that would have been rendered impossible or close to impossible without it. Let’s go with requiring the password on every boot since that provides substantial benefits over just locking out the configuration options.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>We should be careful with calling it more secure IMO - the bootloader password may be harder to bypass, but the BIOS password is necessary to complicate attacks that involve booting from an external USB drive. They both have their pros and cons, and ideally should be used together.</p>
<p>Also, we should consider how whatever tooling we make for setting this password interacts with FDE. A user with high security requirements might use BIOS password, bootloader password, FDE passphrase, and a user account password, preferably all different. Most users with moderate security requirements will get away with just FDE though, and those with lower requirements can use a BIOS + bootloader password and avoid the overhead and potential data loss risk of FDE. Do we want our tool to tell the user “You’re using FDE, you probably don’t need a bootloader password”? If so, should we make some brief in-tool documentation that explains the threat models each configuration might be used to defend against?</p> ]]></description>

<p>Right. The the protection provided by the BIOS power-on password isn’t that great. It’s a “hardware magic feature”. Some BIOS can be reset with:</p>

<li>removal of CMOS battery,</li>

<p>There might be some BIOS resistant to that, designed to not easily being reset, but that is dependent on the hardware producer and may be dependent on the BIOS settings.</p>

        <title>Harden GRUB bootloader using bootloader password</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@arraybolt3]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>I think I see where I’m misunderstanding - I’m thinking of using BIOS and bootloader passwords specifically for preventing access to advanced configuration settings, i.e. the system can be <em>booted</em> without either password, but dropping to a GRUB shell or booting from an external drive using the BIOS should require one of the system passwords. In this context the passwords are only useful for preventing unauthorized root access and denying the ability to tamper with the system’s storage without removing the internal drive. Thus ability to gain root access on an unencrypted system has been the threat I’ve been considering most strongly. I think you’re thinking about these passwords being used to prevent even bootup, such that the system is essentially bricked unless you possess both BIOS and bootloader passwords. This way the passwords are used not just to prevent unauthorized root, but as a form of authentication to even use the system. We should decide on which one we’re discussing so that we’re both talking about the same thing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Doesn’t a BIOS password alone already prevent all of that and requires taking out the drive or some other physical attack?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>If the BIOS password only prevents getting into BIOS options, no, it does not. One simply has to drop to a GRUB console (trivially doable on many EFI systems by repeatedly pressing <kbd>Esc</kbd> during bootup) and they can then boot any arbitrary OS by hand, including one provided on an external USB drive. Similarly, if you have a bootloader password but not BIOS password, you can trivially bypass it by booting from an external drive using the BIOS’s boot functionality. Only password-protecting both seriously complicates attacks that involve booting from an external drive.</p>
<p>If the BIOS password prevents booting the machine too, then yes, it does do all of that already. But in that situation a bootloader password isn’t all that useful, except as defense-in-depth against a relatively unskilled adversary.

<p>Then surely the question will come up “in which cases it does not suffice?” The answer is most likely, in complex cases which are not applicable to the reader, because if these were applicable, the question would not come up. One case that can be constructed is some sort of corporate setup.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I think this is applicable to everyday users too though, whether you’re requiring passwords for bootup or for config access. Depending on the difficulty of opening a device, being forced to take the drive out of the machine to modify it is a very significant hurdle that an attacker may not have the opportunity to carry out (i.e. someone who gains physical access to a machine but only for a very short period of time, and who has to leave the machine more-or-less intact once their attack is complete, this is basically the classic evil maid scenario). Some machines even have soldered internal storage, especially cheap, lightweight devices like “HP Stream” and “onn.” machines - this makes this class of attack nearly impossible without access to advanced, expensive equipment for desoldering the storage chips and resoldering them onto something that allows reading and writing them.</p>

<p>A BIOS password alone will stop most non-technical attackers. More technical attackers who steal the hard drive would be stopped by FDE. That’s why BIOS password + FDE always seemed to be as the most important passwords.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The bootloader password is still valuable though, even against a non-technical attacker, if the passwords are being used to prevent bootup entirely. Many machines have a manufacturer-provided backdoor for resetting BIOS passwords, and tools for exploiting these backdoors are publicly available on the open Internet (<a href="https://bios-pw.org/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://bios-pw.org/</a> is a good example). For machines such as this, a non-technical attacker can probably bypass the BIOS password easily enough, but then they have the bootloader password to contend with. Obviously at this point an attacker with slightly more skill would insert a live USB into the victim machine and boot from that, but there are plenty of attackers who lack that skill, especially in domestic abuse situations, so this still seems valuable to me, even if the benefits are limited at best.</p>

<p>But a reboot will go through BIOS or are you referring to kexec? (I don’t know if GRUB can be load somehow using kexec.)</p>

<p>I meant a reboot that goes through BIOS. Assuming the system is not password-protected, you can easily gain a root shell on Kicksecure without the root or user passwords by following <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Recovery#Recovery_Mode" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Recovery - Kicksecure</a>. An FDE password prevents this though.</p>

        <title>Harden DRACUT initramfs-generator by disabling Recovery Console?</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@Patrick]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>Right. So similar to <a href="https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/harden-grub-bootloader-using-bootloader-password/723/6" class="inline-onebox">Harden GRUB bootloader using bootloader password - #6 by Patrick</a> there could be a corporate setup use case.</p>
<p>A malicious employee could manage to corrupt some system files to then get a dracut recovery shell.</p>
<p>Or the complex VM related attack you’ve described.</p>
<p>We could set <code>rd.shell=0 rd.emergency=halt</code> in security-misc. (And then undo the setting in debug-misc, if not already the case.)</p>
<p>But we would only set it for <code>GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT</code> (default boot entry) or <code>GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX</code> (all boot entries, including recovery boot entry)?</p>
<p>The kernel parameters <code>rd.shell=0 rd.emergency=halt</code> can be modified or unset from GRUB boot menu. But those who worry about that, can either set a BIOS password and/or a bootloader password, depending on their threat model.</p>
<p>Setting it for default (non-recovery) boot menu entries might makes sense. Because those who want to protect Linux recovery mode boot entries, need to set a GRUB root password anyhow.</p>

        <title>Harden GRUB bootloader using bootloader password</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@Patrick]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <blockquote>
<p>It might help to clarify under what situations a bootloader password provides a meaningful level of additional security.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I am documenting that here: <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Protection_Against_Physical_Attacks#Bootloader_Password">Bootloader Password</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>From my standpoint, you have to have at least a bootloader password, a root password, and a BIOS password for it to be useful at all (the root password keeps you from gaining privileges when powered on, the bootloader password keeps you from gaining privileges by rebooting and entering recovery mode, and the BIOS password keeps you from gaining privileges by rebooting into an OS on an external drive).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Doesn’t a BIOS password alone already prevent all of that and requires taking out the drive or some other physical attack?</p>
<p>Well, one could add the assumption that the adversary has a BIOS password bypass. Then the bootloader password might help. This might be an unrealistic assumption.</p>
<p>I think a BIOS password + FDE pre boot authentication password is sufficient “in most cases”.</p>
<p>Then surely the question will come up “in which cases it does not suffice?” The answer is most likely, in complex cases which are not applicable to the reader, because if these were applicable, the question would not come up. One case that can be constructed is some sort of corporate setup.</p>
<p>For example, an employee is given a BIOS password for booting from the internal hard drive, but not from other devices. Furthermore, the employee is allowed to boot using the standard/default option but prevented from booting the recovery boot option, because that password would be retained for system administrators only.</p>

<blockquote>

</aside>
<p>I guess it depends on the threat model. Physical attacks while powered on are always a very high risk situation.</p>
<p>I however was thinking of BIOS password, bootloader password, FDE password, Linux user password, Linux root/sudo password in terms physical attacks while the machine is powered off.</p>
<p>A BIOS password alone will stop most non-technical attackers. More technical attackers who steal the hard drive would be stopped by FDE. That’s why BIOS password + FDE always seemed to be as the most important passwords.</p>
<p>If a physical attacker gets to run (passwordless) sudo, as mentioned in the xkcd, I might not mind much, as most sensitive data is accessible already when logged in as user (not root).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the bootloader password keeps you from gaining privileges by rebooting</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But a reboot will go through BIOS or are you referring to kexec? (I don’t know if GRUB can be load somehow using kexec.)</p>
<p>Good, you could say not having a sudo password will allow a physical attacker to run kexec. But is that even still neeed? → xkcd</p>
<p>In that threat model that I am considering here now, physical attacks while powered are excluded. [1]</p>

</aside>
<p>Right. I would exclude that form that threat model anyhow due to xkcd.</p>
<hr>
<p>In conclusion, the bootloader password seems to only make sense in niche cases.</p>
<ul>
<li>BIOS password bypass included in the threat model</li>
<li>corporate (alike) situations</li>
<li>adversary taking out the hard drive and attempting to boot it in a different computer (circumventing BIOS password) (but then FDE would be much more important)</li>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I guess it depends. Theoretically an attacker could try to gain a root shell on a system by fooling some privileged component of the system into damaging boot files, then reboot and have a root shell. That would let them turn a data corruption vulnerability into a privilege escalation one. Blocking the Dracut recovery shell prevents that - the attacker can use the data corruption vuln to render the system unbootable, but can’t use that to then gain root access. If the system under attack was a physical system, this wouldn’t be that important to defend against since the user is probably using FDE which would prevent this sort of attack too, but if the system under attack if an unencrypted VM hosted on a server, then this would be a reasonable attack to fear and I can see this being a good mitigation for it.</p> ]]></description>

        <title>Harden GRUB bootloader using bootloader password</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@arraybolt3]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>It might help to clarify under what situations a bootloader password provides a meaningful level of additional security. From my standpoint, you have to have at least a bootloader password, a root password, and a BIOS password for it to be useful at all (the root password keeps you from gaining privileges when powered on, the bootloader password keeps you from gaining privileges by rebooting and entering recovery mode, and the BIOS password keeps you from gaining privileges by rebooting into an OS on an external drive). At that point you have to take the drive out of the victim computer in order to attack it easily.</p>
<p>With FDE, the bootloader password is only able to help prevent an attacker from easily modifying the contents of the disk blindly, and it still needs to be combined with a BIOS password to do that effectively.</p>
<p>I don’t see a whole lot of value in enabling a bootup password. That should be FDE’s job. On systems with soldered storage, a bootup password might complicate attacks, but FDE can do the same thing with all systems, even if those systems use non-soldered storage like a SATA or NVMe drive. I do see value in pairing a BIOS password with a bootloader password that prevents config modifications or boot menu access though, since the attacker now at least has to remove the storage drive from the victim system in order to tamper with the disk contents. The memory issue you bring up is helpful, but as long as the bootloader and admin passwords are the same, that should help avoid memory problems.</p>

<p>Yeah, that’s a decent point. If our app was the canonical “how to change your password” app in Kicksecure, that would help prevent that problem, but then there’s probably a feature in XFCE that will change only just the user password, and of course <code>passwd</code> exists. Not sure how to deal with that…</p> ]]></description>

</aside>
<p>In theory nice, but when changing 1 password (such as the Linux user account admin password), coudln’t the GRUB bootloader (root) password get desync? That could be confusing.</p>
<p>In theory, always asking for a bootloader password might make most sense. This lowers the chance that the user will forget the password when needed. (If never asked for GRUB user password but then 1 year later being asked for GRUB root password could be an issue.)</p> ]]></description>

<p>I guess an argument could be made why it should be different but then “100” different passwords is bad usability. Those who insist on different passwords for everything should be able to set them. But if we provide a tool to easily set up a GRUB password, using the same password as user <code>user</code> or <code>admin</code> (?) might make sense.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>It may be worth asking, do we want this to be separate from the user password? Having a bootloader password makes little sense if the user account isn’t password-protected and passwordless sudo is available. Similarly, for unencrypted systems, having a user password isn’t very helpful if the bootloader has no password set. Lastly, for most users, it probably makes sense for the bootloader and admin user passwords to be the same. So perhaps the tool that does this should set user and bootloader passwords?</p> ]]></description>

        <title>Morphing LMDE 6 to Kicksecure</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@LMDE]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>HI all,<br>
I realise morphing Linux Mint Debian edition to Kicksecure is unsupported, but I’m interested in learning from the experience of anyone who has done this. One thing I’m wondering is how updates will work after morphing. Will I continue to get updates from Linux Mint? Are there any big problems you’ve encountered?<br>
Thanks</p>
<p>Edit:<br>
Hi Patrick,<br>
Thanks for replying. Yes, I’m aware of those links/options. That’s why I specifically stated I know it’s unsupported. I was hoping for some feedback and discussion from other users, not support from the team.</p>
<p>If such discussions are not allowed here, can you direct me to somewhere they are allowed?</p>
<p>I’ve searched and there are very few discussions of Kicksecure + Linux Mint elsewhere on the web. I’m not surprised as it’s increasingly difficult to ask questions anywhere these days.</p>
<p>I’ve asked a similar question on the Linux Mint forums and they also closed the topic, saying it wasnt relevant to Mint and I should ask the question on Kicksecure forums. The rules for posting on Reddit forums are labyrinthine and arbitrary at the same time.</p>
<p>So, if such a discussion can’t be allowed here either, where are Kicksecure users supposed to learn from each other? Please consider reopening this topic or else consider adding a forum section where users are able to discuss things among themselves without expecting involvement from the Kicksecure team. This would be another valuable learning resource.<br>
Regards</p> ]]></description>

I tried to follow the existing conventions when it came to how configuration was fetched, making a new class for the map of restricted filesystems for mountpoints and handling default configuration values in much the same way as other parts of the code handled them. I don't like the way I had to plumb PartitionCoreModule and Config objects into areas of the code that didn't used to use them, but it was the only way I could see to do the job and still be consistent.

There are some major shortcomings still left in the code:

* &lt;s&gt;For mountpoint-specific filesystem whitelists, I'm not taking into account that un-mountable filesystems should always be allowed, even though I document that this is taken into account. This **must** be fixed before this can be merged.&lt;/s&gt; Resolved.
* &lt;s&gt;It doesn't take into account the case when mountpoint `/a` can be filesystem X, mountpoint `/a/b` cannot be filesystem X, and the user chooses to only make a partition for mountpoint `/a` and leave `/a/b` on the same filesystem as `/a`. In that instance the user could set `/a` to be filesystem X, and thus `/a/b` would also be filesystem X, despite that being prohibited.&lt;/s&gt; Resolved, the UX isn't awesome but it does work.
* &lt;s&gt;No testing has been done yet, at all. I don't even know if Calamares will launch with this.&lt;/s&gt; Did some testing, it's working decent so far.

I'm not sure if this is the right approach to this, or if I should be approaching the problem in a fundamentally different way. I'm happy to scrap the patch and try again if this isn't the right way to do this.

EDIT: The code is mostly working now. It still needs a good test plan written and thoroughly tested before it's merge-ready, but it seems to work right, and is ready for review.</span></p>

<p>So in theory, a user who wants to run VMs on the server might end up installing virt-viewer, gnome-boxes, or similar, and end up pulling in the SPICE client library, which then in turn pulls in this obscure SUID executable for dealing with one portion of USB passthrough. For users who actually need USB passthrough, this is fine, but for other users, it could potentially be an issue.</p>
<p>This is really hypothetical though. Why would someone install gnome-boxes (a desktop application) on a server? If they want to run VMs on a server, they’d install libvirt on it, and then connect to libvirt using software like virt-manager from a client machine. So meh. I personally would rather leave it out of the exceptions for servers, but it’s not something I’m set on. If you’re happier with it shared, I’m fine with that.</p> ]]></description>

<p><code>spice-client-glib-usb-acl-helper</code> isn’t installed by default in Kicksecure (or Whonix). Not even inside VMs.</p>

<p><code>spice-client-glib-usb-acl-helper</code> isn’t installed by default and doesn’t install itself using <code>apt install spice-client-glib-usb-acl-helper</code> by accident either.

<p>Finally. the binary is setuid. Obscure-but-insecure things are where a lot of vulnerabilities are found, like the recent CUPS RCE.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>That’s why permission hardener disables many historically used SUIDs that are nowadays no longer popular (at least not by Kicksecure (or Whonix) users).</p>
<p>Some examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>write SUID, wall SUID</li>
<li>passwd SUID (using it with sudo instead, multi-users desktops are not popular where this is required)</li>
<li>su (using sudo instead, maybe <a href="https://forums.whonix.org/t/replace-sudo-with-doas/17482" class="inline-onebox">Replace sudo with doas - Development - Whonix Forum</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>These are well suitable for permission hardener, since these are installed by default and hard (infeasible? / impossible?) to not have installed by default.</p>
<p>This is the main motivation for permission hardener. To disable SUIDs where it’s not strictly required for most users, yet having these binaries around is “mandatory”.</p>
<p>However, for packages such as <code>spice-client-glib-usb-acl-helper</code> maybe, the SUID functionality might be specifically wanted by the user?</p> ]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>Hmm, I see a lot of your points here. I think the only one I disagree with is the SPICE whitelist point - the <code>spice-client-glib-usb-acl-helper</code> being granted an exception from permission-hardener here is apparently only used when a host is passing through USB devices to a guest. (See <a href="https://packages.debian.org/sid/misc/spice-client-glib-usb-acl-helper" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Debian -- Details of package spice-client-glib-usb-acl-helper in sid</a>) I don’t foresee this happening frequently (if ever) on a server. In theory, an attacker could use USB passthrough to compromise a confidential VM should they gain access to the host (use USB-over-IP to connect a malicious USB device to a compromised server remotely, then pass it through to the target VM and exploit a driver within the VM to gain a foothold there). Finally. the binary is setuid. Obscure-but-insecure things are where a lot of vulnerabilities are found, like the recent CUPS RCE.</p> ]]></description>

<p>To expand on that…</p>
<p>Extremely valuable target either due to monetary richness or other factors of power such as public influence. Normal people are not being attacked with such extremely sophisticated malware.</p>
<p>So if this is a priority issue for your to resolve, if affordable, this is the best time ever to hire a professional IT support company, malware researcher. (No specific recommendations are being made.)</p>
