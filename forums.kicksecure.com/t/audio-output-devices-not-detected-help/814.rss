    <title>Audio output devices not detected - Help</title>
    <link>https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/audio-output-devices-not-detected-help/814</link>
    <description>I just installed Kicksecure but I can&#39;t get sound, not even when I plug in headphones to the audio jack. The Volume Control doesn&#39;t show any output devices besides the dummy output but my laptop&#39;s speakers worked with Windows and the monitor that it&#39;s plugged into via HDMI also has speakers which have been tested working with Qubes OS 4.2 and Fedora Workstation 41. How can I get the audio to work? Any help is much appreciated!</description>
