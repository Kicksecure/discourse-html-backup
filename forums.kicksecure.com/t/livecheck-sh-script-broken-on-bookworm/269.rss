    <title>Livecheck.sh script broken on bookworm</title>
    <link>https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/livecheck-sh-script-broken-on-bookworm/269</link>
    <description>Please excuse the throwaway account. I just want to anonymously report this issue:
After upgrading Whonix (/Kicksecure) from bullseye to bookworm with the release-upgrade script provided, the livecheck.sh script will allways detect that there is something mounted in read-write (and therefore show this in the systray). This is due to the weird fact, that since bookworm, lsblk -all shows empty loop devices from 0-7 that are all read-write and hence trigger livecheck.sh to believe the system is mounted in read-write.
I was not able to understand why these loop devices are present in bookworm.

This all occurs with the system correctly being mounted in read-only and started with grub-live, therefore confusing users.</description>
