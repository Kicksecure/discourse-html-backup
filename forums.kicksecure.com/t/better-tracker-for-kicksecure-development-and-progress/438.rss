    <description>I think it would help the community and devs if there was some type of progress board where different features, issues, and testing was tracked and laid out better.
A place to list things that are most needed to be tested like **high priority** and *low priority* to get to the end goal of a released Kicksecure ISO.


TailsOS uses Issue boards but they are also using GitLab not GitHub. 
Something like Issue boards/Milestones (which are more like a progress tracker) that would be great for moving the project forward.</description>
