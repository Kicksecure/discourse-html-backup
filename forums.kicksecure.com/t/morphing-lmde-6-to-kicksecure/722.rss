    <title>Morphing LMDE 6 to Kicksecure</title>
    <link>https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/morphing-lmde-6-to-kicksecure/722</link>
    <description>HI all,
I realise morphing Linux Mint Debian edition to Kicksecure is unsupported, but I&#39;m interested in learning from the experience of anyone who has done this. One thing I&#39;m wondering is how updates will work after morphing. Will I continue to get updates from Linux Mint? Are there any big problems you&#39;ve encountered?
Thanks</description>
