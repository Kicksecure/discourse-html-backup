        <title>GrapheneOS Attacks Kicksecure! What should the response be?</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@qtzvytqr77x4t5cq]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>I do not know what the correct forum category is to post this. I presume that this category is okay? Please move the topic if there is a better forum category for it.</p>
<p><a href="https://xcancel.com/GrapheneOS/status/1861465637886754839#m" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://xcancel.com/GrapheneOS/status/1861465637886754839#m</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Kicksecure is awful. Has a horrible choice of base OS for security and they don’t do valuable work to improve it. They sabotaged security efforts and are spreading misinformation about allocator hardening and other topics they don’t understand.</p>
<p>Secureblue is doing useful work.</p>
<p>The concept used by Whonix for forcing traffic through Tor makes sense but the OS has awful security, just like the Tor Browser itself having awful security. Someone making an equivalent out of Fedora Silverblue or Arch would obsolete it.</p>
<p>Kicksecure/Whonix doesn’t do any significant hardening and the efforts to do that were stalled and then rolled back when the person responsible for most of it left the project. It has some minor anonymity changes easily done elsewhere. Encrypted swap is widely used elsewhere.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Presumably, you all disagree with Daniel Micay / GrapheneOS. What is the rebuttal here?</p>
<p>Thank you for your responses.</p> ]]></description>

<p>Sure, I get that and I respect that. But at the same time, it sounded like you had done experimentation on unsupported but still likely-to-work platforms, and ran into problems on a fully supported platform (i.e. distro-morphing vanilla Debian). Naturally this is concerning, so we did some bug hunting to see if we could reproduce the issue the same way.</p>
<p>Before I go and try to install Debian with KDE Plasma, could you please tell me <strong>which release of Debian are you using?</strong> You can find out by running <code>cat /etc/os-release</code> in a terminal. Please share the entire <code>VERSION</code> variable shown in the command’s output.</p> ]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>We use standard debian. I dont even know where to find other debian repositories. According to cinnamon, problem was only in LMDE.<br>
But problems with kde plasma were on all computers and in all systems - debian, lmde, mx, sparky. The main problem with sddm is precisely at startup (if autologin is disabled, which kicksecure launches by default). I also had this problem. It cannot be reproduced when changing user or ending session - only when starting. Sleep mode hung on 3 computers of which there are 5 - on debian and 2 on mx. Solution to problems has always been one - removing security-misc.<br>
This topic is dedicated to other linuxes and is listed on the site as a discussion of kicksecure in other OS. That’s why I shared my experience here. But, once again, debian kde plasma had all same problems. I helped friends to log debian 2 weeks ago, when sddm did not let them in after updating security-misc, They launched console mode and deleted security-misc - problem disappeared. Maybe it is a hardware issue. BUT it was also on old laptops and on new ones from 5 different companies</p> ]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>I have now tested distro morphing Debian 12 Cinnamon into Kicksecure on physical hardware (my main development machine). I used <code>kicksecure-xfce-host</code> this time since it sounded like that’s what you were using. I still can’t reproduce the issue - the install works just fine, security-misc is present, LightDM doesn’t freeze whether I feed it good passwords or bad passwords, sleep works out of the box.</p>
<p>If you and your friend are both running into issues, it’s likely to be the result of one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>What you’re calling Debian is not what I’m calling Debian. I’m using the official Debian 12 (Bookworm) netinstaller, which gives me a vanilla Debian installation. This is what Kicksecure supports, so it’s expected to work. If your “Debian” is Debian 11 (Bullseye) or Debian Testing (Trixie at the time of this writing), that could be the problem.</li>
<li>You and your friend happen to use the same third-party repository on your systems, and that repository is incompatible with Kicksecure in some way.</li>
<li>Both of you are shockingly unlucky when it comes to what hardware you ended up with. (Hardware-specific issues like this are relatively rare nowadays so I wouldn’t expect this to be the case.)</li>
</ul>
<p>I don’t know for sure if any of the above apply here, this is just what comes to mind initially. If there’s any further data you can give about how you’re reproducing this (what software versions you’re using, what steps you’re taking, even hardware info might come in handy), that might help debug this. Currently though I can’t get it to break.</p> ]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>Hmm, I hadn’t thought about this being a Calamares feature request, though I guess that makes sense now that you mention it. I see there’s already an open report that you’ve interacted with at <a href="https://github.com/calamares/calamares/issues/2137" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Allow Calamares to set GRUB password · Issue #2137 · calamares/calamares · GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>Then again, do we <em>want</em> it in Calamares for Kicksecure? We’d be introducing more system state changing bits into the installer, which I know is something we’ve wanted to avoid in the past. It might be better to have a custom tool within the OS that the user can use to set or change the password. Such a tool would be usable in preinstalled VMs as well as newly installed systems.</p>
<p>If we were to use the custom tool solution, I don’t think this is something we could easily upstream somewhere, though it may be worth looking for existing tools that do this.

        <description><![CDATA[ <p><a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Protection_Against_Physical_Attacks#How_to_set_a_bootloader_password">How to set a bootloader password</a> has been documented thanks to <a class="mention" href="https://forums.kicksecure.com/u/nurmagoz">@nurmagoz</a>.</p>
<p>If we had a simple script to automate these simple but non-trivial steps, that would be good progress.</p>
<p>Could that be upstreamed somewhere?</p>

<p>I think the only thing I’d really like to add to all of the above is that we document how to make the Dracut recovery console available again. I’ve used it for multiple debugging sessions that would have been rendered impossible or close to impossible without it.</p>

<p>We should be careful with calling it more secure IMO - the bootloader password may be harder to bypass, but the BIOS password is necessary to complicate attacks that involve booting from an external USB drive. They both have their pros and cons, and ideally should be used together.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also, we should consider how whatever tooling we make for setting this password interacts with FDE. A user with high security requirements might use BIOS password, bootloader password, FDE passphrase, and a user account password, preferably all different. Most users with moderate security requirements will get away with just FDE though, and those with lower requirements can use a BIOS + bootloader password and avoid the overhead and potential data loss risk of FDE. Do we want our tool to tell the user “You’re using FDE, you probably don’t need a bootloader password”? If so, should we make some brief in-tool documentation that explains the threat models each configuration might be used to defend against?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Probably yes.</p>
<p>Step 1: Writing good documention explaining all of what we discussed in the wiki on <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Protection_Against_Physical_Attacks" class="inline-onebox">Protection against Physical Attacks</a>.</p>
<p>Step 2: This might be quite difficult to get the usability design right. Perhaps this should be discussed with calamares for wider input?</p> ]]></description>

        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@sam]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>me and my friends used standard morphing installation. i would be grateful if you wrote installation for kde plasma and cinnamon. what commands to enter instead of sudo apt install --no-install-recommends kicksecure-xfce-host. But i also installed separate packages - grub-live, security-misc, tirdad and sdwdate - this also led to login hang. Perhaps there are nuances on the virtual machine, so there are no records of sleep mode and sddm. but i have not yet seen a host system that would not have sddm hang after last security-misc update. in some computers sddm hangs only after an incorrect password. in other computers (and mine) when entering any password. but sleep mode does not hang on my computer and on the computer of one friend, but on two other friends sleep mode always hangs - removing security-misc solved this problem. Even installing only one security-misc package on cde plasma and cinnamon caused freezes. I thought the conflict was only with cde plasma, but recently my friend’s LMDE also froze Lightdm</p>
<p>in old versions of security-misc, these problems were not there. only problem was the wrong password entry in sddm at startup. but sleep mode worked well for everyone. If you install kicksecure xfce morph and remove security-misc, then there are no problems and errors - this has been tested on all the OSes I mentioned</p> ]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>You’ll have to give more specific steps for how to reproduce this. I’ve just attempted to reproduce the issue using Debian 12 + KDE Plasma, on a UEFI-based virt-manager machine. The exact steps taken are:</p>

<li>Set RAM to 4 GB, disk space to 20 GB</li>
<li>Check “Customize configuration before installing” on the final screen of the VM creation wizard</li>

<li>Partition 2: ext4 mounted at <code>/</code>, use all remaining disk space</li>

<li>Desktop environment: KDE Plasma</li>
<li>Timezone and locale settings set appropriately</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Once installation is complete, reboot</li>
<li>Carefully follow instructions at <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Debian" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Install Kicksecure inside Debian</a> to morph the distribution into Kicksecure, some notes as to how I followed the instructions:
<ul>
<li>When given the option of using extrepo or manual configuration for initially adding the Kicksecure repository, I chose manual configuration.</li>
<li>Signing key was downloaded using TLS.</li>
<li>“Clearnet Rep.” settings were used for manually configuring the Kicksecure repo.</li>
<li>The Kicksecure metapackage I installed was <code>kicksecure-cli-host</code>, to avoid pulling in XFCE</li>
<li>Before following post-installation steps, I rebooted, tested login via SDDM with both Plasma X11 and Plasma Wayland sessions, confirmed it worked, and confirmed <code>security-misc</code> was installed using <code>dpkg-query -s security-misc</code> (it came back as <code>install ok installed</code>)</li>
<li>In the post-installation steps, I used <code>sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list</code> rather than <code>sudo mv /etc/apt/sources.list ~/</code> for getting rid of the original sources.list file, it contained nothing important</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>With this setup, Kicksecure is installed, <code>security-misc</code> is installed, and SDDM login works just fine, both with Wayland and X11 options. <s>I did not test sleep since this is a virtual machine and getting a virt-manager VM out of sleep can be <em>really hard</em>, but I would expect it to work.</s> EDIT: Just tested sleep too, works without issues, even with <code>security-misc</code> installed.</p>
<p>Some things about your configuration that you may want to double-check that may be the source of some of the issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Did you install <code>kicksecure-cli-host</code> or <code>kicksecure-xfce-host</code>? Doing the latter on a machine with another desktop environment already will end up installing XFCE on the machine, which could conflict with your existing desktop environment in interesting ways.</li>
<li>Is your user account named <code>user</code>? There are some subsystems in Kicksecure that only allow an account named <code>user</code> to take certain actions. It’s possible (though unlikely) that the inability to take those actions with another account could be causing the issue.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ve not yet tested with the Cinnamon desktop, or with Debian derivatives such as Sparky or Mint.</p> ]]></description>

        <title>Harden GRUB bootloader using bootloader password</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@arraybolt3]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>I think I like the idea, especially in combination with disabling “easy” recovery mode and the Dracut recovery console. I think the only thing I’d really like to add to all of the above is that we document how to make the Dracut recovery console available again. I’ve used it for multiple debugging sessions that would have been rendered impossible or close to impossible without it. Let’s go with requiring the password on every boot since that provides substantial benefits over just locking out the configuration options.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>We should be careful with calling it more secure IMO - the bootloader password may be harder to bypass, but the BIOS password is necessary to complicate attacks that involve booting from an external USB drive. They both have their pros and cons, and ideally should be used together.</p>
<p>Also, we should consider how whatever tooling we make for setting this password interacts with FDE. A user with high security requirements might use BIOS password, bootloader password, FDE passphrase, and a user account password, preferably all different. Most users with moderate security requirements will get away with just FDE though, and those with lower requirements can use a BIOS + bootloader password and avoid the overhead and potential data loss risk of FDE. Do we want our tool to tell the user “You’re using FDE, you probably don’t need a bootloader password”? If so, should we make some brief in-tool documentation that explains the threat models each configuration might be used to defend against?</p> ]]></description>

<p>Right. The the protection provided by the BIOS power-on password isn’t that great. It’s a “hardware magic feature”. Some BIOS can be reset with:</p>

<li>removal of CMOS battery,</li>

<p>There might be some BIOS resistant to that, designed to not easily being reset, but that is dependent on the hardware producer and may be dependent on the BIOS settings.</p>

        <title>Harden GRUB bootloader using bootloader password</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@arraybolt3]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>I think I see where I’m misunderstanding - I’m thinking of using BIOS and bootloader passwords specifically for preventing access to advanced configuration settings, i.e. the system can be <em>booted</em> without either password, but dropping to a GRUB shell or booting from an external drive using the BIOS should require one of the system passwords. In this context the passwords are only useful for preventing unauthorized root access and denying the ability to tamper with the system’s storage without removing the internal drive. Thus ability to gain root access on an unencrypted system has been the threat I’ve been considering most strongly. I think you’re thinking about these passwords being used to prevent even bootup, such that the system is essentially bricked unless you possess both BIOS and bootloader passwords. This way the passwords are used not just to prevent unauthorized root, but as a form of authentication to even use the system. We should decide on which one we’re discussing so that we’re both talking about the same thing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Doesn’t a BIOS password alone already prevent all of that and requires taking out the drive or some other physical attack?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>If the BIOS password only prevents getting into BIOS options, no, it does not. One simply has to drop to a GRUB console (trivially doable on many EFI systems by repeatedly pressing <kbd>Esc</kbd> during bootup) and they can then boot any arbitrary OS by hand, including one provided on an external USB drive. Similarly, if you have a bootloader password but not BIOS password, you can trivially bypass it by booting from an external drive using the BIOS’s boot functionality. Only password-protecting both seriously complicates attacks that involve booting from an external drive.</p>
<p>If the BIOS password prevents booting the machine too, then yes, it does do all of that already. But in that situation a bootloader password isn’t all that useful, except as defense-in-depth against a relatively unskilled adversary.

<p>Then surely the question will come up “in which cases it does not suffice?” The answer is most likely, in complex cases which are not applicable to the reader, because if these were applicable, the question would not come up. One case that can be constructed is some sort of corporate setup.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I think this is applicable to everyday users too though, whether you’re requiring passwords for bootup or for config access. Depending on the difficulty of opening a device, being forced to take the drive out of the machine to modify it is a very significant hurdle that an attacker may not have the opportunity to carry out (i.e. someone who gains physical access to a machine but only for a very short period of time, and who has to leave the machine more-or-less intact once their attack is complete, this is basically the classic evil maid scenario). Some machines even have soldered internal storage, especially cheap, lightweight devices like “HP Stream” and “onn.” machines - this makes this class of attack nearly impossible without access to advanced, expensive equipment for desoldering the storage chips and resoldering them onto something that allows reading and writing them.</p>

<p>A BIOS password alone will stop most non-technical attackers. More technical attackers who steal the hard drive would be stopped by FDE. That’s why BIOS password + FDE always seemed to be as the most important passwords.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The bootloader password is still valuable though, even against a non-technical attacker, if the passwords are being used to prevent bootup entirely. Many machines have a manufacturer-provided backdoor for resetting BIOS passwords, and tools for exploiting these backdoors are publicly available on the open Internet (<a href="https://bios-pw.org/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://bios-pw.org/</a> is a good example). For machines such as this, a non-technical attacker can probably bypass the BIOS password easily enough, but then they have the bootloader password to contend with. Obviously at this point an attacker with slightly more skill would insert a live USB into the victim machine and boot from that, but there are plenty of attackers who lack that skill, especially in domestic abuse situations, so this still seems valuable to me, even if the benefits are limited at best.</p>

<p>But a reboot will go through BIOS or are you referring to kexec? (I don’t know if GRUB can be load somehow using kexec.)</p>

<p>I meant a reboot that goes through BIOS. Assuming the system is not password-protected, you can easily gain a root shell on Kicksecure without the root or user passwords by following <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Recovery#Recovery_Mode" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Recovery - Kicksecure</a>. An FDE password prevents this though.</p>

        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@Patrick]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>Right. So similar to <a href="https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/harden-grub-bootloader-using-bootloader-password/723/6" class="inline-onebox">Harden GRUB bootloader using bootloader password - #6 by Patrick</a> there could be a corporate setup use case.</p>
<p>A malicious employee could manage to corrupt some system files to then get a dracut recovery shell.</p>
<p>Or the complex VM related attack you’ve described.</p>
<p>We could set <code>rd.shell=0 rd.emergency=halt</code> in security-misc. (And then undo the setting in debug-misc, if not already the case.)</p>
<p>But we would only set it for <code>GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT</code> (default boot entry) or <code>GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX</code> (all boot entries, including recovery boot entry)?</p>
<p>The kernel parameters <code>rd.shell=0 rd.emergency=halt</code> can be modified or unset from GRUB boot menu. But those who worry about that, can either set a BIOS password and/or a bootloader password, depending on their threat model.</p>
<p>Setting it for default (non-recovery) boot menu entries might makes sense. Because those who want to protect Linux recovery mode boot entries, need to set a GRUB root password anyhow.</p>

        <title>Harden GRUB bootloader using bootloader password</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@Patrick]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <blockquote>
<p>It might help to clarify under what situations a bootloader password provides a meaningful level of additional security.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I am documenting that here: <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Protection_Against_Physical_Attacks#Bootloader_Password">Bootloader Password</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>From my standpoint, you have to have at least a bootloader password, a root password, and a BIOS password for it to be useful at all (the root password keeps you from gaining privileges when powered on, the bootloader password keeps you from gaining privileges by rebooting and entering recovery mode, and the BIOS password keeps you from gaining privileges by rebooting into an OS on an external drive).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Doesn’t a BIOS password alone already prevent all of that and requires taking out the drive or some other physical attack?</p>
<p>Well, one could add the assumption that the adversary has a BIOS password bypass. Then the bootloader password might help. This might be an unrealistic assumption.</p>
<p>I think a BIOS password + FDE pre boot authentication password is sufficient “in most cases”.</p>
<p>Then surely the question will come up “in which cases it does not suffice?” The answer is most likely, in complex cases which are not applicable to the reader, because if these were applicable, the question would not come up. One case that can be constructed is some sort of corporate setup.</p>
<p>For example, an employee is given a BIOS password for booting from the internal hard drive, but not from other devices. Furthermore, the employee is allowed to boot using the standard/default option but prevented from booting the recovery boot option, because that password would be retained for system administrators only.</p>

<blockquote>

</aside>
<p>I guess it depends on the threat model. Physical attacks while powered on are always a very high risk situation.</p>
<p>I however was thinking of BIOS password, bootloader password, FDE password, Linux user password, Linux root/sudo password in terms physical attacks while the machine is powered off.</p>
<p>A BIOS password alone will stop most non-technical attackers. More technical attackers who steal the hard drive would be stopped by FDE. That’s why BIOS password + FDE always seemed to be as the most important passwords.</p>
<p>If a physical attacker gets to run (passwordless) sudo, as mentioned in the xkcd, I might not mind much, as most sensitive data is accessible already when logged in as user (not root).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the bootloader password keeps you from gaining privileges by rebooting</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But a reboot will go through BIOS or are you referring to kexec? (I don’t know if GRUB can be load somehow using kexec.)</p>
<p>Good, you could say not having a sudo password will allow a physical attacker to run kexec. But is that even still neeed? → xkcd</p>
<p>In that threat model that I am considering here now, physical attacks while powered are excluded. [1]</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Right. I would exclude that form that threat model anyhow due to xkcd.</p>
<hr>
<p>In conclusion, the bootloader password seems to only make sense in niche cases.</p>
<ul>
<li>BIOS password bypass included in the threat model</li>
<li>corporate (alike) situations</li>
<li>adversary taking out the hard drive and attempting to boot it in a different computer (circumventing BIOS password) (but then FDE would be much more important)</li>
</ul>
<p>Please correct me if I am wrong. Happy to present the full threat model analysis in the wiki.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I guess it depends. Theoretically an attacker could try to gain a root shell on a system by fooling some privileged component of the system into damaging boot files, then reboot and have a root shell. That would let them turn a data corruption vulnerability into a privilege escalation one. Blocking the Dracut recovery shell prevents that - the attacker can use the data corruption vuln to render the system unbootable, but can’t use that to then gain root access. If the system under attack was a physical system, this wouldn’t be that important to defend against since the user is probably using FDE which would prevent this sort of attack too, but if the system under attack if an unencrypted VM hosted on a server, then this would be a reasonable attack to fear and I can see this being a good mitigation for it.</p> ]]></description>

        <title>Harden GRUB bootloader using bootloader password</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@arraybolt3]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>It might help to clarify under what situations a bootloader password provides a meaningful level of additional security. From my standpoint, you have to have at least a bootloader password, a root password, and a BIOS password for it to be useful at all (the root password keeps you from gaining privileges when powered on, the bootloader password keeps you from gaining privileges by rebooting and entering recovery mode, and the BIOS password keeps you from gaining privileges by rebooting into an OS on an external drive). At that point you have to take the drive out of the victim computer in order to attack it easily.</p>
<p>With FDE, the bootloader password is only able to help prevent an attacker from easily modifying the contents of the disk blindly, and it still needs to be combined with a BIOS password to do that effectively.</p>
<p>I don’t see a whole lot of value in enabling a bootup password. That should be FDE’s job. On systems with soldered storage, a bootup password might complicate attacks, but FDE can do the same thing with all systems, even if those systems use non-soldered storage like a SATA or NVMe drive. I do see value in pairing a BIOS password with a bootloader password that prevents config modifications or boot menu access though, since the attacker now at least has to remove the storage drive from the victim system in order to tamper with the disk contents. The memory issue you bring up is helpful, but as long as the bootloader and admin passwords are the same, that should help avoid memory problems.</p>

<p>Yeah, that’s a decent point. If our app was the canonical “how to change your password” app in Kicksecure, that would help prevent that problem, but then there’s probably a feature in XFCE that will change only just the user password, and of course <code>passwd</code> exists. Not sure how to deal with that…</p> ]]></description>

</aside>
<p>I guess an argument could be made why it should be different but then “100” different passwords is bad usability. Those who insist on different passwords for everything should be able to set them. But if we provide a tool to easily set up a GRUB password, using the same password as user <code>user</code> or <code>admin</code> (?) might make sense.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>It may be worth asking, do we want this to be separate from the user password? Having a bootloader password makes little sense if the user account isn’t password-protected and passwordless sudo is available. Similarly, for unencrypted systems, having a user password isn’t very helpful if the bootloader has no password set. Lastly, for most users, it probably makes sense for the bootloader and admin user passwords to be the same. So perhaps the tool that does this should set user and bootloader passwords?</p> ]]></description>

        <title>Morphing LMDE 6 to Kicksecure</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@LMDE]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>HI all,<br>
I realise morphing Linux Mint Debian edition to Kicksecure is unsupported, but I’m interested in learning from the experience of anyone who has done this. One thing I’m wondering is how updates will work after morphing. Will I continue to get updates from Linux Mint? Are there any big problems you’ve encountered?<br>
Thanks</p>
<p>Edit:<br>
Hi Patrick,<br>
Thanks for replying. Yes, I’m aware of those links/options. That’s why I specifically stated I know it’s unsupported. I was hoping for some feedback and discussion from other users, not support from the team.</p>
<p>If such discussions are not allowed here, can you direct me to somewhere they are allowed?</p>
<p>I’ve searched and there are very few discussions of Kicksecure + Linux Mint elsewhere on the web. I’m not surprised as it’s increasingly difficult to ask questions anywhere these days.</p>
<p>I’ve asked a similar question on the Linux Mint forums and they also closed the topic, saying it wasnt relevant to Mint and I should ask the question on Kicksecure forums. The rules for posting on Reddit forums are labyrinthine and arbitrary at the same time.</p>
<p>So, if such a discussion can’t be allowed here either, where are Kicksecure users supposed to learn from each other? Please consider reopening this topic or else consider adding a forum section where users are able to discuss things among themselves without expecting involvement from the Kicksecure team. This would be another valuable learning resource.<br>
Regards</p> ]]></description>

I tried to follow the existing conventions when it came to how configuration was fetched, making a new class for the map of restricted filesystems for mountpoints and handling default configuration values in much the same way as other parts of the code handled them. I don't like the way I had to plumb PartitionCoreModule and Config objects into areas of the code that didn't used to use them, but it was the only way I could see to do the job and still be consistent.

There are some major shortcomings still left in the code:

* &lt;s&gt;For mountpoint-specific filesystem whitelists, I'm not taking into account that un-mountable filesystems should always be allowed, even though I document that this is taken into account. This **must** be fixed before this can be merged.&lt;/s&gt; Resolved.
* &lt;s&gt;It doesn't take into account the case when mountpoint `/a` can be filesystem X, mountpoint `/a/b` cannot be filesystem X, and the user chooses to only make a partition for mountpoint `/a` and leave `/a/b` on the same filesystem as `/a`. In that instance the user could set `/a` to be filesystem X, and thus `/a/b` would also be filesystem X, despite that being prohibited.&lt;/s&gt; Resolved, the UX isn't awesome but it does work.
* &lt;s&gt;No testing has been done yet, at all. I don't even know if Calamares will launch with this.&lt;/s&gt; Did some testing, it's working decent so far.

I'm not sure if this is the right approach to this, or if I should be approaching the problem in a fundamentally different way. I'm happy to scrap the patch and try again if this isn't the right way to do this.

EDIT: The code is mostly working now. It still needs a good test plan written and thoroughly tested before it's merge-ready, but it seems to work right, and is ready for review.</span></p>
