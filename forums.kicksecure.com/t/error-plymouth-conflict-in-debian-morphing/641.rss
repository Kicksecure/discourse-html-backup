    <description>sudo apt install --no-install-recommends kicksecure-xfce-host - Conflict with Plymouth after entering this command when morphing Debian, MX Linux and LMDE. This error was made by me and all my friends. Today, my friend also received it. *sudo apt remove plymouth* resolves problem. Write about it in morphing instructions so that people know what to do in this situation. It seems that someone has complained about this error on this forum</description>
